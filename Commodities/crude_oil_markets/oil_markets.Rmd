## Crude Oil: A Brief History 

The first modern well was drilled in 1859 near Titusville in western Pennsylvania.

- Around the same time, oil was being produced (first by digging then by drilling) in Ontario, Canada.

- Much of this oil was refined into kerosene.

## Lucas Gusher at Spindletop

The Texas oil boom was kicked off in 1901, when oil was found in the Spindletop field in Beaumont, Texas.

## Prices Through 1973

Crude oil prices didn't fluctuate much prior to 1973.

- A set of U.S. oil companies held the price stable with production controls. These *Seven Sisters*, as they were known, were Anglo-Persian Oil (now BP), Gulf Oil, Jersey Standard Oil (now Exxon), Royal Dutch Shell, Standard Oil of California (now Chevron), Standard Oil of New York (Socony), and Texaco. 

- After the Yom Kippur war in 1973, control of crude oil prices transferred to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), an inter-governmental organization started in 1960 by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.  Prices have since become more volatile.

## Crude Oil Price Benchmarks

Today, three types of oil serve as global benchmarks for other oil prices:

1.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI): the U.S. price benchmark

2.  Brent North Sea: the European price benchmark

3.  Dubai: the Asian price benchmark

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Crude Oil Grades

Crude oil is graded by density (light/heavy) and sulphur content (sweet/sour).  

- Low density (light) and low sulphur (sweet) is cheaper to refine than more heavy and sour crude oil.

-  For example, both WTI and Brent are light sweet crudes (but WTI is lighter and sweeter), whereas Dubai is medium sour.

- For this reason, historically (that is, prior to 2010), WTI has traded at a premium to Brent.  Since 2010, the difference in grade has been more than offset by the supply of crude from North Dakota and the western Canadian provinces.

## U.S. Crude Oil Production

The U.S. produces about 8 million barrels of crude per day.  

-  U.S. production has increased since the introduction of technology to extract tight oil (oil from shale formations such as the Bakken formation in western North Dakota).

## U.S. Crude Oil Consumption

The U.S. consumes about 18 million barrels of crude oil per day.  

- Crude oil is primarily refined into gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## U.S. Crude Export Restrictions

Crude oil exports are restricted by the 'Energy Policy and Conservation Act' of 1975, which directs the President “to promulgate a rule prohibiting the export of crude oil” produced in the U.S.  This act was passed after the OPEC embargo.

- Given the recent production increase in the U.S., there is pressure for the President to allow increased exports. 

<!---  crude oil derived from fields under the State waters of Alaska's Cook Inlet; (2) Alaskan North Slope crude oil; (3) certain domestically produced crude oil destined for Canada; (4) shipments to U.S. territories; and (5) California crude oil to Pacific Rim countries. -->

## Crude Oil and the Macroeconomy

In a study from the year 2000, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) [estimated](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/oil/2000/oilrep.PDF) a \$5 increase in crude oil prices reduces global economic growth by 0.3\% in the following year. 

Also, since crude oil is used in the transport and production of many goods, it is a prominent driver of inflation.

Accordingly, it is closely watched by the Federal Reserve when setting monetary policy.

## Crude Oil and the Stock Market

Sharp increases in oil prices tend to lower stock prices. 

- Research [has shown](http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeejfinec/v_3a89_3ay_3a2008_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a307-327.htm) that market participants accurately estimate the effect of higher oil prices on firm cash flows, and so stock prices fall accordingly.  

- Other work [has concluded](http://econpapers.repec.org/article/blajfinan/v_3a51_3ay_3a1996_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a463-91.htm) that oil may even be able to predict *future* stock market returns.
