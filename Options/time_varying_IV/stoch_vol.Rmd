## Characteristics of Implied Volatility

Implied volatility is the market's expectation of a security's volatility extracted from option prices on that security.  It is the volatility expected over the life of that option.  We calculate Implied Volatility using the [Black-Scholes option pricing model](http://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/black-scholes) -- solving the equation for volatility and plugging in the option price we observe in the market.  

Here we take a look at two important observations involving implied volatility.

1. Implied volatility is a function of the option's moneyness.  This is known as the *option smile* (or sometimes referred to as the *option smirk*).

2. Implied volatility is is a function of the option's expiration date (known as the option's tenor).  

3. Implied volatility changes over time, and so does the functional relationships in 1 and 2.

## Implications for Derivative Pricing

Note, the existence of 1, 2, and 3, are each a deviation from the assumptions underlying the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 

In modern derivative pricing in complete markets, we have to hedge away any source of uncertainty in the underlying security.  So any additional risk introduced by the above observations would have to be able to be hedged away to price the derivative.

## The Option Smile

The option smile shows the dependence of an option's implied volatility on the option's moneyness, which is defined as the option's strike price divided by the underlying security's price.  

-  Generally the option smile for equity markets looks like the chart on the next slide. Note this looks more like a *skew* or *smirk*.  

- Implied volatility is highest when the underlying security is much higher than the strike (deep out-of-the-money put, and in-the-money call, options).

## Typical Shape of Option Smile in Equity Markets

```{r echo = FALSE}
  library(metricsgraphics)
  renderMetricsgraphics({
      gendata <- data.frame(IV_1_Month = c(0.33, 0.24, .18, 0.15, 0.09, .08),
			    #                             IV_2_Month = c(0.3, 0.21, .15, 0.13, 0.09, .08),
			    #                             IV_3_Month = c(0.25, 0.17, .15, 0.13, 0.10, .09),
                            Moneyness = c(round(0.6, 1), 0.75, .85, 0.9, 1.05, 1.15)
                            )
      gendata %>%
    mjs_plot(x = Moneyness, y = IV_1_Month) %>%
        mjs_line() %>%
    #         mjs_add_line(IV_2_Month) %>%
    #         mjs_add_line(IV_3_Month) %>%
        mjs_add_legend(legend = c("IV 1 Month", "IV 2 Month", "IV 3 Month")) %>%
        mjs_labs(x = "Moneyness", y = "Implied Volatility")
      })
 
```

## The Smile for Differing Expirations

The option smile is known to take different shapes depending on the options expiration.  The general form of the smile is the same, although the sensitivity of implied volatility to moneyness may be different for varying expirations.  

-  The option smile is often visualized across expirations, in what is known as the *volatility surface*.  

-  The next slide shows how the smile is affected by option tenor.  The visualization is done with a 3D scatter plot instead of a surface so you see actual IV values, and nothing is interpolated.

-  The chart is done using [plotly](https://plot.ly/products/industries/finance-analytics/).
