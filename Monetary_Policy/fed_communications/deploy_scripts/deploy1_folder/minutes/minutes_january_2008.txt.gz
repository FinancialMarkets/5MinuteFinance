Program for Security of FOMC Information. The amendments primarily addressed the 
Committee's practice of approving the minutes via notation vote, attendance at 
Committee meetings, and access to Committee information by System employees.

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was selected to execute 
transactions for the System Open Market Account.

By unanimous vote, William C. Dudley was selected to serve at the pleasure of 
the Committee as Manager, System Open Market Account, on the understanding that 
his selection was subject to being satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York.

By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations was 
reaffirmed in the form shown below:

AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
(Reaffirmed January 29, 2008)

1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic 
policy directive adopted at a meeting of the Committee:

(a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including securities of the 
Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully 
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States in 
the open market, from or to securities dealers and foreign and international 
accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, 
or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market Account at market prices, 
and, for such Account, to exchange maturing U.S. Government and Federal agency 
securities with the Treasury or the individual agencies or to allow them to 
mature without replacement;

(b) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are direct obligations 
of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the 
United States, from dealers for the account of the System Open Market Account 
under agreements for repurchase of such securities or obligations in 65 business 
days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the 
Committee, shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable 
limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers.

(c) To sell U.S. Government securities and obligations that are direct 
obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency 
of the United States to dealers for System Open Market Account under agreements 
for the resale by dealers of such securities or obligations in 65 business days 
or less, at rates that, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, 
shall be determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable 
limitations on the volume of agreements with individual dealers.

2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the 
Federal Open Market Committee authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to 
lend on an overnight basis U.S. Government securities held in the System Open 
Market Account to dealers at rates that shall be determined by competitive 
bidding. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York shall set a minimum lending fee 
consistent with the objectives of the program and apply reasonable limitations 
on the total amount of a specific issue that may be auctioned and on the amount 
of securities that each dealer may borrow. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
may reject bids which could facilitate a dealer's ability to control a single 
issue as determined solely by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while 
assisting in the provision of short-term investments for foreign and 
international accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and 
accounts maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as fiscal agent of 
the United States pursuant to Section 15 of the Federal Reserve Act, the Federal 
Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York (a) for System Open Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to 
such accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under agreements 
providing for the resale by such accounts of those securities in 65 business 
days or less on terms comparable to those available on such transactions in the 
market; and (b) for New York Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with 
dealers, subject to the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities 
in paragraph l(b), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency 
securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase agreements between 
its own account and such foreign, international, and fiscal agency accounts 
maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such accounts under the 
provisions of this paragraph may provide for a service fee when appropriate.

4. In the execution of the Committee's decision regarding policy during any 
intermeeting period, the Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, upon the instruction of the Chairman of the Committee, to 
adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the degree of pressure on reserve 
positions and hence the intended federal funds rate. Any such adjustment shall 
be made in the context of the Committee's discussion and decision at its most 
recent meeting and the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and 
sustainable economic growth, and shall be based on economic, financial, and 
monetary developments during the intermeeting period. Consistent with Committee 
practice, the Chairman, if feasible, will consult with the Committee before 
making any adjustment.

By unanimous vote, the Committee approved the Authorization for Foreign Currency 
Operations with an amendment to paragraph 1.D. regarding the maximum open 
position in all foreign currencies. Accordingly, the Authorization for Foreign 
Currency Operations was adopted, as shown below:

AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS
(Amended January 29, 2008)

1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to the extent necessary to 
carry out the Committee's foreign currency directive and express authorizations 
by the Committee pursuant thereto, and in conformity with such procedural 
instructions as the Committee may issue from time to time:

A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the form of cable 
transfers through spot or forward transactions on the open market at home and 
abroad, including transactions with the U.S. Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange 
Stabilization Fund established by Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, 
with foreign monetary authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, 
and with other international financial institutions:

Canadian dollars
Danish kroner
Euro
Pounds sterling
Japanese yen
Mexican pesos
Norwegian kroner
Swedish kronor
Swiss francs
B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts to receive or 
to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A above.

C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw dollars under 
the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph 2 below, provided that 
drawings by either party to any such arrangement shall be fully liquidated 
within 12 months after any amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, 
unless the Committee, because of exceptional circumstances, specifically 
authorizes a delay.

D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies not exceeding 
$25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open position in all foreign 
currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding signs) of net positions in 
individual currencies, excluding changes in dollar value due to foreign exchange 
rate movements and interest accruals. The net position in a single foreign 
currency is defined as holdings of balances in that currency, plus outstanding 
contracts for future receipt, minus outstanding contracts for future delivery of 
that currency, i.e., as the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.

2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements ("swap" arrangements) for the 
System Open Market Account for periods up to a maximum of 12 months with the 
following foreign banks, which are among those designated by the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, 
Relations with Foreign Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee 
to renew such arrangements on maturity:

Foreign bank	Amount of arrangement
(millions of dollars equivalent)
Bank of Canada	2,000
Bank of Mexico	3,000
Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the proposed terms 
of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall be referred for review and 
approval to the Committee.

3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 1.A. above 
shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, be at prevailing 
market rates. For the purpose of providing an investment return on System 
holdings of foreign currencies or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates 
paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign 
central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.

4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the 
coordination of foreign currency transactions. In making operating arrangements 
with foreign central banks on System holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York shall not commit itself to maintain any specific 
balance, unless authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements 
or understandings concerning the administration of the accounts maintained by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign banks designated by the 
Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for 
review and approval to the Committee.

5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested to ensure that adequate liquidity 
is maintained to meet anticipated needs and so that each currency portfolio 
shall generally have an average duration of no more than 18 months (calculated 
as Macaulay duration). Such investments may include buying or selling outright 
obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign 
government or agency thereof; buying such securities under agreements for 
repurchase of such securities; selling such securities under agreements for the 
resale of such securities; and holding various time and other deposit accounts 
at foreign institutions. In addition, when appropriate in connection with 
arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency holdings, 
U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign central banks under 
agreements for repurchase of such securities within 30 calendar days.

6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be 
reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee. The 
Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 
Committee, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors, and such other member of 
the Board as the Chairman may designate (or in the absence of members of the 
Board serving on the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the 
Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the 
Committee, his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the 
request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open Market 
Account ("Manager"), for the purposes of reviewing recent or contemplated 
operations and of consulting with the Manager on other matters relating to his 
responsibilities. At the request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions 
arising from such reviews and consultations shall be referred for determination 
to the Federal Open Market Committee.

7. The Chairman is authorized:

A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed agreement or 
understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about the division of 
responsibility for foreign currency operations between the System and the 
Treasury;

B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning System foreign 
currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary on policy matters 
relating to foreign currency operations;

C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and information to the 
National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.

8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit pertinent 
information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of 
the Treasury Department.

9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign currency 
operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3G(1) of the Board of 
Governors' Statement of Procedure with Respect to Foreign Relationships of 
Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.

By unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive was reaffirmed in the form 
shown below:

FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE
(Reaffirmed January 29, 2008)

1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be directed at 
countering disorderly market conditions, provided that market exchange rates for 
the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior consistent with IMF Article IV, 
Section 1.

2. To achieve this end the System shall:

A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign exchange.

B. Maintain reciprocal currency ("swap") arrangements with selected foreign 
central banks.

C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other countries and with 
international monetary institutions.

3. Transactions may also be undertaken:

A. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies.

B. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments in particular 
currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.

C. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the Committee.

4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:

A. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the United States 
Treasury;

B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary authorities; and

C. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United States in the 
International Monetary Fund regarding exchange arrangements under IMF Article 
IV.

By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency 
Operations were reaffirmed in the form shown below:

PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS
(Reaffirmed January 29, 2008)

In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction of the 
Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the Authorization for Foreign 
Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, through the Manager, System Open Market Account ("Manager"), shall 
be guided by the following procedural understandings with respect to 
consultations and clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency 
Subcommittee, and the Chairman of the Committee. All operations undertaken 
pursuant to such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.

1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the Chairman, if the 
Chairman believes that consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the 
time available):

A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open 
position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on any day or $600 million 
since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.
B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the System's net 
position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150 million, or $300 million 
when the operation is associated with repayment of swap drawings.
C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of trading in a 
particular currency by the System, even though the change in the System's net 
position in that currency might be less than the limits specified in 1.B.
D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the larger of (i) 
$200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.
2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the Subcommittee, if the 
Subcommittee believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible 
in the time available, or with the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that 
consultation with the Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):

A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System's overall open 
position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion since the most recent 
regular meeting of the Committee.
B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the larger of (i) $200 
million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap arrangement.
3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about 
proposed swap drawings by the System and about any operations that are not of a 
routine character.

The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in 
foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign 
currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting. 
The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on 
System open market operations in government securities and federal agency 
obligations during the period since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the 
Committee ratified these transactions.

The information reviewed at the January meeting, which included the advance data 
on the national income and product accounts for the fourth quarter, indicated 
that economic activity had decelerated sharply in recent months. The contraction 
in homebuilding intensified in the fourth quarter, the growth in consumer 
spending slowed, and survey measures of both consumer and business sentiment 
were at low levels. In addition, industrial production contracted in the fourth 
quarter. Conditions in the labor market deteriorated noticeably, with private 
payroll employment posting a small decline in December and the unemployment rate 
rising. Readings on both headline and core inflation increased in recent months, 
although the twelve-month change in prices of core personal consumption 
expenditures in December was about the same as its year-earlier value.

On average, private nonfarm payroll employment in November and December rose at 
only about half of the average pace seen from July to October. Over 2007 as a 
whole, the deterioration in labor demand was most pronounced in the construction 
and financial activities industries, which had been hardest hit by the 
difficulties in the housing and mortgage markets. Manufacturing employment 
declined yet again in December, while the decrease in employment in retail trade 
nearly reversed the sizable increase in that sector recorded in November. 
Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in 
December.  The unemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent in December after having 
been at or near 4.7 percent since September.

Industrial production declined in the fourth quarter, as a drag from motor 
vehicles and construction-related industries more than offset a positive 
contribution from other industries. Output in high-tech industries moderated in 
the fourth quarter, largely because of a deceleration in production of computers 
and semiconductors. Utilities output climbed for a second consecutive quarter, 
and mining output was boosted by increases in natural gas extraction and in 
crude oil.

The rise in real consumer spending moderated in the fourth quarter, with outlays 
on non-auto consumer goods increasing weakly. Spending on services rose solidly 
in November (the most recent month available), led by energy services and 
commissions paid to stockbrokers, but warmer-than-usual temperatures in December 
likely damped expenditures for energy services in that month. Sales of light 
motor vehicles were moderate during the fourth quarter. Real disposable personal 
income was little changed in the fourth quarter, held down by higher consumer 
energy prices. Also, the wealth-to-income ratio ticked down in the third 
quarter, and appeared likely to decline again in the fourth quarter, as equity 
prices had fallen since the end of the third quarter and available indicators 
pointed to continued declines in house prices in the fourth quarter. In 
December, readings on consumer sentiment remained at relatively low levels by 
historical standards.

Both single-family housing starts and permit issuance fell in December. 
Meanwhile, multifamily housing starts plunged in December, but permit issuance 
pointed to a rebound in multifamily starts in the near term. New home sales 
dropped in November and December after having held relatively steady since 
August, keeping inventories of unsold homes at elevated levels. Sales of 
existing homes also moved down in December but, on balance, had declined less in 
recent months than sales of new homes. Demand for housing through the end of 
2007 likely continued to be restrained by tight financing conditions for jumbo 
and nonprime mortgages.

Real spending on equipment and software rose at a sluggish rate in the fourth 
quarter after having posted a solid increase in the third quarter. Sales of 
medium and heavy trucks edged up after falling to a four-year low. Spending on 
high-tech capital goods increased at a moderate pace over the second half of 
last year. Outside of the transportation and high-tech sectors, spending on 
equipment appeared to have declined last quarter after having posted sizable 
gains over the summer. Orders and shipments rose somewhat in the fourth quarter, 
but imports in the first two months of the quarter were below their average in 
the third quarter. Nonresidential construction remained vigorous in the fourth 
quarter. However, indicators of future spending in this sector pointed to a 
slowdown in coming months, with a decline in architectural billings, a rise in 
retail-sector vacancy rates, and survey reports that contractors were 
experiencing more difficulty in obtaining funding. More generally, surveys of 
business conditions and sentiment deteriorated and suggested that capital 
spending would be reduced in the near term.

Real nonfarm inventory investment excluding motor vehicles appeared to have 
stepped up from its average rate over the first three quarters of 2007. In 
November, the ratio of manufacturing and trade book-value inventories (excluding 
motor vehicles) to sales ticked down.

The U.S. international trade deficit widened slightly in October and then more 
substantially in November, as increases in imports in both months more than 
offset increases in exports. The increases in imports almost entirely reflected 
a jump in the value of imported oil. Non-oil goods imports were boosted by a 
large increase in imports of consumer goods and small increases in several other 
categories, which more than offset a steep decline in imports of non-oil 
industrial supplies. Imports of automotive products and capital goods recorded 
modest gains, with the increase in capital goods primarily reflecting a jump in 
imports of telecommunications equipment. Imports of services grew strongly. 
Exports in both months were boosted by higher exports of services. Exports of 
industrial supplies also recorded a strong gain, aided by a large increase in 
exports of fuels in November. Higher exports of semiconductors, aircraft, and 
machinery pushed up exports of capital goods, while exports of agricultural 
goods increased only slightly following a large jump in the third quarter. In 
contrast, exports of consumer goods fell from their third-quarter level.

Economic growth in the advanced foreign economies appeared to have slowed in the 
fourth quarter, with recent data on household expenditures and retail sales 
weakening on balance and consumers and businesses considerably less upbeat about 
growth prospects. In Japan, the estimate of real GDP growth in the third quarter 
was revised down, and business sentiment declined in December amidst concerns 
about high oil prices. In the euro area, retail sales growth declined in October 
and November, and consumer and business surveys in November and December pointed 
to economic weakness. In the United Kingdom, although real GDP grew solidly in 
the fourth quarter, the estimate of third-quarter real GDP growth was revised 
down. In Canada, indicators suggested that growth in economic activity moderated 
in the fourth quarter. Private employment shrank in December after having posted 
very strong growth in November. Incoming data on emerging-market economies 
pointed, on balance, to a slowing of growth in the fourth quarter. Overall, 
growth in emerging Asia appeared to have moderated somewhat in the fourth 
quarter, with trade balances declining in several countries as exports slowed. 
Readings on economic activity in Latin America were more mixed. Incoming data 
suggested that growth slowed in Mexico in the fourth quarter. In Brazil , 
third-quarter growth was solid, but indicators for the fourth quarter were 
mixed. Economic activity appeared to be strong in Argentina in both the third 
and fourth quarters.

In the United States, headline consumer price inflation stepped up noticeably in 
November and December from the low rates posted in the summer. Part of the 
increase reflected the rapid rise in energy prices, but prices of core personal 
consumption expenditures (PCE) also moved up faster in those months than they 
had earlier in the year. The pickup in core PCE inflation over the second half 
of 2007 reflected an acceleration in prices that had been unusually soft earlier 
in the year, such as prices for apparel, prescription drugs, and nonmarket 
services. For the year as a whole, core PCE prices increased at about the same 
rate as they had in 2006. Household survey measures of expectations for 
year-ahead inflation picked up in November and remained at that level in 
December and January. Households' longer-term inflation expectations rose in 
December but ticked down in January. Average hourly earnings increased faster in 
November and December than they had in October, although over the twelve months 
that ended in December, this wage measure rose a bit more slowly than the 
elevated pace posted in 2006.

At its December meeting, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate 
25 basis points, to 4-1/4 percent. In addition, the Board of Governors approved 
a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate, to 4-3/4 percent, leaving 
the gap between the federal funds rate target and the discount rate at 50 basis 
points. The Committee's statement noted that incoming information suggested that 
economic growth was slowing, reflecting the intensification of the housing 
correction and some softening in business and consumer spending. Moreover, 
strains in financial markets had increased in recent weeks. The Committee 
indicated that its action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, 
should help promote moderate growth over time. Readings on core inflation had 
improved modestly during the year, but elevated energy and commodity prices, 
among other factors, might put upward pressure on inflation. In this context, 
the Committee judged that some inflation risk remained and said that it would 
continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Recent developments, 
including the deterioration in financial market conditions, had increased the 
uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation. The 
Committee stated that it would continue to assess the effects of financial and 
other developments on economic prospects and would act as needed to foster price 
stability and sustainable economic growth.

Over the intermeeting period, the expected path of monetary policy over the next 
year as measured by money market futures rates tilted down sharply, primarily in 
response to softer-than-expected economic data releases. The Committee's action 
at its December meeting was largely anticipated by market participants, although 
some investors were surprised by the absence of any indication of accompanying 
measures to address strains in term funding markets. Some of that surprise was 
reversed the next day, following the announcement of a Term Auction Facility 
(TAF) and associated swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss 
National Bank. The subsequent release of the minutes of the meeting elicited 
little market reaction. However, investors did mark down the expected path of 
policy in response to speeches by Federal Reserve officials; the speeches were 
interpreted as suggesting that signs of broader economic weakness and additional 
financial strains would likely require an easier stance of policy. The 
Committee's decision to reduce the target federal funds rate 75 basis points on 
January 22 surprised market participants and led investors to mark down further 
the path of policy over the next few months. Consistent with the shift in the 
economic outlook, the revision in policy expectations, and the reduction in the 
target federal funds rate, yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities declined 
substantially over the period since the December FOMC meeting. The yield curve 
steepened somewhat further, with the two-year yield dropping more than the 
ten-year yield. Near-term inflation compensation increased in early January amid 
rising oil prices, but it retreated in later weeks, along with oil prices, and 
declined, on net, over the period.

Conditions in short-term funding markets improved notably over the intermeeting 
period, but strains remained. Spreads of rates on securities in interbank 
funding markets over risk-free rates narrowed somewhat following the 
announcement of the TAF on December 12 and eased considerably after year-end, 
although they remained at somewhat elevated levels. Spreads of rates on 
asset-backed commercial paper over risk-free rates also fell, on net, and the 
level of such paper outstanding increased in the first two weeks of January for 
the first time since August. In longer-term corporate markets, yields on 
investment-grade corporate bonds fell less than those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities, while yields on speculative-grade bonds rose considerably. 
As a result, corporate bond spreads climbed to their highest levels since early 
2003, apparently reflecting increased concern among investors about the outlook 
for corporate credit quality over the next few years. Nonetheless, gross bond 
issuance in December remained strong. Commercial bank credit expanded briskly in 
December, supported by robust growth in business loans and in nonmortgage loans 
to households, and in the face of survey reports of tighter lending conditions. 
Over the intermeeting period, spreads on conforming mortgages over 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities remained about flat, as did spreads on 
jumbo mortgages, although credit availability for jumbo-mortgage borrowers 
continued to be tight. Broad stock price indexes fell over the intermeeting 
period on perceptions of a deteriorating economic outlook and additional 
write-downs by financial institutions. Similar stresses were again evident in 
the financial markets of major foreign economies. The trade-weighted foreign 
exchange value of the dollar against major currencies declined slightly, on 
balance, over the intermeeting period.

Debt in the domestic nonfinancial sector was estimated to have increased 
somewhat more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the third. The rate of 
increase of nonfinancial business debt decelerated in the fourth quarter from 
its rapid third-quarter pace despite robust bond issuance as the rise in 
commercial and industrial lending moderated. Household mortgage debt expanded at 
a slow rate in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued weakness in home prices, 
declining home sales, and tighter credit conditions for some borrowers. 
Nonmortgage consumer credit appeared to expand at a moderate pace. In December, 
the increase in M2 was up slightly from its November pace, boosted primarily by 
inflows into the relative safety and liquidity of money market mutual funds. The 
rise in small time deposits moderated but remained elevated, as several thrift 
institutions offered attractive deposit rates to secure funding. In contrast, 
liquid deposits continued to increase weakly and currency contracted noticeably, 
the latter apparently reflecting an ongoing trend in overseas demand away from 
U.S. dollar bank notes and towards the euro and other currencies.

In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff revised up slightly its 
estimated increase in aggregate economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2007 
but revised down its projected increase for the first half of 2008. Although 
data on consumer spending and nonresidential construction activity for the 
fourth quarter had come in above the staff's expectations, most of the 
information received over the intermeeting period was weaker than had been 
previously expected. The drop in housing activity continued to intensify, 
conditions in labor markets appeared to have deteriorated noticeably near 
year-end, and factory output had weakened. Consumer confidence remained low, and 
indicators of business sentiment had worsened. Equity prices had also fallen 
sharply so far in 2008, and, while the functioning of money markets had 
improved, conditions in some other financial markets had become more 
restrictive. The staff projection showed the weakness in spending dissipating 
over the second half of 2008 and 2009, in response to the cumulative easing of 
monetary policy since August, the abatement of housing weakness, a lessening 
drag from high oil prices, and the prospect of fiscal stimulus. Still, projected 
resource utilization was lower over the next two years than in the previous 
forecast. The projection for core PCE price inflation in 2008 was raised 
slightly in response to elevated readings in recent months. The forecast for 
headline PCE price inflation also incorporated a somewhat higher rate of 
increase for energy prices for the first half of 2008; as a result, headline PCE 
price inflation was now expected to exceed core PCE price inflation slightly for 
that year. The forecasts for both headline and core PCE price inflation for 2009 
were unchanged, with both receding from their 2008 levels.

In conjunction with the FOMC meeting in January, all meeting participants 
(Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents) provided annual 
projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation for the period 2008 
through 2010. The projections are described in the Summary of Economic 
Projections, which is attached as an addendum to these minutes.

In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, and in the 
projections that they had submitted for this meeting, participants noted that 
information received since the December meeting had been decidedly downbeat on 
balance. In particular, the drop in housing activity had intensified, factory 
output had weakened, news on business investment had been soft, and conditions 
in labor markets appeared to have deteriorated. In addition, consumer confidence 
had remained low and business confidence appeared to have worsened. Although the 
functioning of money markets had improved notably, strains remained evident in a 
number of other financial markets, and credit conditions had become generally 
more restrictive. Against this backdrop, participants expected economic growth 
to remain weak in the first half of this year before picking up in the second 
half, aided in part by a more accommodative stance of monetary policy and by 
likely fiscal stimulus. Further ahead, participants judged that economic growth 
would continue to pick up gradually in 2009 and 2010. Nonetheless, with housing 
activity and house prices still declining and with financial conditions for 
businesses and households tightening further, significant uncertainties 
surrounded this outlook and the risks to economic growth in the near term 
appeared to be weighted to the downside. Indeed, several participants noted that 
the risks of a downturn in the economy were significant. Inflation data had been 
disappointing in recent months, and a few participants cited anecdotal reports 
that some firms were able to pass on costs to consumers. However, with inflation 
expectations anticipated to remain reasonably well anchored, energy and other 
commodity prices expected to flatten out, and pressures on resources likely to 
ease, participants generally expected inflation to moderate somewhat in coming 
quarters.

Meeting participants observed that conditions in short-term funding markets had 
improved considerably since the December meeting, reflecting the easing of 
pressures related to funding around the turn of the year as well as the 
implementation of the TAF. However, broader financial conditions had tightened 
significantly, on balance, in the weeks leading up to the meeting, as evidence 
of further deterioration in housing markets and investors' more pessimistic view 
of the economic outlook adversely affected a range of financial markets. Many 
participants were concerned that the drop in equity prices, coupled with the 
ongoing decline in house prices, implied reductions in household wealth that 
would likely damp consumer spending. Moreover, elevated volatility in financial 
markets likely reflected increased uncertainty about the economic outlook, and 
that greater uncertainty could lead firms and households to limit spending. The 
availability of credit to consumers and businesses appeared to be tightening, 
likely adding to restraint on economic growth. Participants discussed the risks 
to financial markets and institutions posed by possible further deterioration in 
the condition of financial guarantors, and many perceived a possibility that 
additional downgrades in these firms' credit ratings could put increased strains 
on financial markets. To be sure, some positive financial developments were 
evident. Banks appeared to be making some progress in strengthening their 
balance sheets, with several financial institutions able to raise significant 
amounts of capital to offset the large losses they had suffered in recent 
quarters. Nevertheless, participants generally viewed financial markets as still 
vulnerable to additional economic and credit weakness. Some noted the especially 
worrisome possibility of an adverse feedback loop, that is, a situation in which 
a tightening of credit conditions could depress investment and consumer 
spending, which, in turn, could feed back to a further tightening of credit 
conditions.

In their discussion of individual sectors of the economy, meeting participants 
emphasized that activity in housing markets had continued to deteriorate 
sharply. With single-family permits and starts still falling, sales of new homes 
dropping precipitously, sales of existing homes flat, and inventories of unsold 
homes remaining elevated even in the face of falling house prices, several 
participants noted the absence of signs of stabilization in the sector. Of 
further concern were the reduced availability of nonconforming loans and the 
apparent tightening by banks of credit standards on mortgages, both of which had 
the potential for intensifying the housing contraction. The recent declines in 
interest rates had spurred a surge in applications for mortgage refinancing and 
would limit the upward resets on the rates on outstanding adjustable-rate 
mortgages, both of which would tend to improve some households' finances. 
Nonetheless, participants viewed the housing situation and its potential further 
effect on employment, income, and wealth as one of the major sources of downside 
risk to the economic outlook.

Recent data as well as anecdotal information indicated that consumer spending 
had decelerated considerably, perhaps partly reflecting a spillover from the 
weakness in the housing sector. Participants remarked that declining house 
prices and sales appeared to be depressing consumer sentiment and that the 
contraction in wealth associated with decreases in home and equity prices 
probably was restraining spending. In addition, consumption expenditures were 
being damped by slower growth in real disposable income induced by high energy 
prices and possibly by a softening of the labor market. The December employment 
report showed that job growth had slowed appreciably, and other indicators also 
pointed to emerging weakness in the labor market in the intermeeting period. And 
spending in the future could be affected by an ongoing tightening in the 
availability of consumer credit amid signs that lenders were becoming 
increasingly cautious in view of some deterioration of credit performance on 
consumer loans and widening expectations of slower income growth. Some 
participants, however, cited evidence that workers in some sectors were still in 
short supply and saw signs that the labor market remained resilient.

The outlook for business investment had turned weaker as well since the time of 
the December meeting. Several participants reported that firms in their 
districts were reducing capital expenditures in anticipation of a slowing in 
sales. Manufacturing activity appeared to have slowed or contracted in many 
districts. Although a few participants reported more upbeat attitudes among 
firms in the technology and energy sectors, business sentiment overall appeared 
to be declining. Moreover, a number of indicators pointed to a tightening in 
credit availability to businesses. For example, the Senior Loan Officer Opinion 
Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicated that banks had tightened lending 
standards and pricing terms on business loans. Lending standards had been raised 
especially sharply on commercial real estate loans. While real outlays for 
nonresidential construction apparently continued to rise through the fourth 
quarter, anecdotal evidence pointed to a weakening of commercial real estate 
spending in several districts, with some projects being canceled or scaled back.

Most participants anticipated that a fiscal stimulus package, including tax 
rebates for households and bonus depreciation allowances for businesses, would 
be enacted before long and would support economic growth in the second half of 
the year. Some pointed out, however, that the fiscal stimulus package might not 
help in the near term, when the risks of a downturn in economic activity 
appeared largest. In addition, the effects of the proposed package would likely 
be temporary, with the stimulus reversing in 2009.

With regard to the external sector, some participants noted that growth abroad 
had recently been strong and that increasing U.S. exports had been a significant 
source of strength for the U.S. economy of late. However, available data 
suggested that economic activity outside the United States appeared to be 
decelerating somewhat. Although slowing foreign growth would reduce a source of 
support for the U.S. economy at the same time that domestic spending was 
slackening, it could also damp commodity prices and help reduce global price 
pressures.

Participants agreed that the inflation data that were received since the 
December meeting had been disappointing. But many believed that the slow growth 
in economic activity anticipated for the first half of this year and the 
associated slack in resource utilization would contribute to an easing of price 
pressures. Moreover, a leveling-off of energy and commodity prices such as that 
embedded in futures markets would also help moderate inflation pressures. 
However, some participants cautioned that commodity prices had remained 
stubbornly high for quite some time and that inferences drawn in the past from 
futures markets about likely trends in such prices had often proven inaccurate. 
Participants also related anecdotal evidence of firms facing increasing input 
cost pressures and in some cases being able to pass on those costs to consumers. 
Moreover, headline inflation had been generally above 2 percent over the past 
four years, and participants noted that such persistently elevated readings 
could ultimately affect inflation expectations. Some survey measures of 
inflation expectations had edged up in recent months, and longer-term financial 
market gauges of inflation compensation had climbed. The latter probably 
reflected at least in part increased uncertainty--inflation risk--rather than 
greater inflation expectations; increases in nominal wages did not appear to be 
incorporating higher inflation expectations. On balance, expectations seemed to 
remain fairly well anchored, but participants agreed that continued stability of 
inflation expectations was essential.

In the discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, most members 
believed that a further significant easing in policy was warranted at this 
meeting to address the considerable worsening of the economic outlook since 
December as well as increased downside risks. As had been the case in some 
previous cyclical episodes, a relatively low real federal funds rate now 
appeared appropriate for a time to counter the factors that were restraining 
economic growth, including the slide in housing activity and prices, the 
tightening of credit availability, and the drop in equity prices. Members judged 
that a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate, together with the 
Committee's previous policy actions, would bring the real short-term rate to a 
level that was likely to help the economy expand at a moderate pace over time. 
Still, with no signs of stabilization in the housing sector and with financial 
conditions not yet stabilized, the Committee agreed that downside risks to 
growth would remain even after this action. Members were also mindful of the 
need for policy to promote price stability, and some noted that, when prospects 
for growth had improved, a reversal of a portion of the recent easing actions, 
possibly even a rapid reversal, might be appropriate. However, most members 
agreed that a 50 basis point easing at this meeting would likely not contribute 
to an increase in inflation pressures given the actual and expected weakness in 
economic growth and the consequent reduction in pressures on resources. Rather, 
members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters, but 
they also concurred that it would be necessary to continue to monitor inflation 
developments carefully.

The Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should 
indicate that financial markets remained under considerable stress, that credit 
had tightened further for some businesses and households, and that recent 
information pointed to a deepening of the housing contraction as well as to some 
softening in labor markets. The Committee again viewed it as appropriate to 
indicate that it expected inflation to moderate in coming quarters but also to 
emphasize that it would be necessary to monitor inflation developments 
carefully. The action taken at the meeting, combined with the cumulative policy 
easing already in place, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to 
mitigate the risks to economic activity. However, members concurred that 
downside risks to growth remained, and that the Committee would continue to 
assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and 
would act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 
domestic policy directive:

“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 
will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To 
further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks 
conditions in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to 
an average of around 3 percent.”

The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 
p.m.:

“The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the 
federal funds rate 50 basis points to 3 percent.

Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened 
further for some businesses and households.  Moreover, recent information 
indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in 
labor markets.

The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be 
necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.

Today's policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote 
moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity.  
However, downside risks to growth remain.  The Committee will continue to assess 
the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will 
act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.”

Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke, Geithner, Kohn, Kroszner, and Mishkin, 
Ms. Pianalto, Messrs. Plosser, Stern, and Warsh.

Votes against this action: Mr. Fisher.

Mr. Fisher dissented because he preferred to leave the federal funds rate 
unchanged. The rate had been lowered by 75 basis points just one week earlier in 
a decision he supported, which brought the funds rate down 175 basis points 
since September. Given these actions, he felt that monetary policy was already 
quite stimulative, while headline inflation was too high at more than 3 percent 
over the last year. Demand-pull inflation pressures from emerging-market 
economies abroad appeared to be continuing, and anecdotal reports from business 
contacts suggested greater willingness domestically to pass rising costs through 
to prices. Moreover, Mr. Fisher was concerned that inflation expectations could 
become unanchored if the perception of negative real rates of interest were to 
become pervasive. At the same time, the economy appeared to be still growing, 
albeit at a substantially weakened pace. Given the policy tradeoffs confronting 
the FOMC at this time, Mr. Fisher saw the upside risks to inflation as being 
greater than the downside risks to longer-term economic growth, especially in 
light of the recent, aggressive easing of monetary policy and the lag before it 
would have its full effect on the economy.

The Committee then turned to a discussion of selected longer-term regulatory and 
structural issues raised by recent financial market developments. A staff 
presentation began by noting that the difficulties in financial markets started 
with unexpectedly heavy losses on subprime mortgages and related structured 
securities, which led investors to question the valuations of complex structured 
instruments more generally and to pull back from such investments. The resulting 
effects in markets put pressure on some large banking organizations, 
particularly through losses on subprime-mortgage-related securities and other 
assets, and through the unplanned expansion of balance sheets triggered by the 
disruption of various markets in which assets were securitized. The remainder of 
the presentation, and the discussion by meeting participants, focused on two 
issues: first, the important role of credit ratings in the securitization 
process, including the methods used to set ratings and the way investors use 
ratings in making their investment decisions; and second, how weaknesses in risk 
management practices at some large global financial services organizations 
appear to have led to outsized losses at those institutions, and the reasons 
that such weaknesses may have emerged at some firms and not at others.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, 
March 18, 2008.

The meeting adjourned at 1:15 p.m.

Notation Vote
By notation vote completed on December 31, 2007, the Committee unanimously 
approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on December 11, 2007.

Conference Calls
On January 9, 2008, the Committee reviewed recent economic data and financial 
market developments. The available information suggested that the downside risks 
to growth had increased significantly since the time of the December FOMC 
meeting. Participants discussed the possibility that the slowing in economic 
growth and associated softening in labor markets might exacerbate the tightening 
in credit conditions and the correction in housing market activity and prices, 
which could in turn weigh further on economic activity. Participants emphasized 
the risks that such adverse dynamics could pose to economic and financial 
stability.

Participants noted that core price inflation had edged up in recent months, 
boosted in part by the pass-through of higher energy costs to the prices of core 
consumer goods and services. Inflation was expected to edge lower this year as 
energy prices leveled off and pressures on resources eased. However, this 
slowing in inflation was dependent on inflation expectations remaining well 
anchored, and participants noted that considerable uncertainty surrounded the 
inflation outlook.

Most participants were of the view that substantial additional policy easing in 
the near term might well be necessary to promote moderate economic growth over 
time and to reduce the downside risks to growth, and participants discussed the 
possible timing of such policy actions.

On January 21, 2008, the Committee again met by conference call. Incoming 
information since the conference call on January 9 had reinforced the view that 
the outlook for economic activity was weakening. Among other developments, 
strains in some financial markets had intensified, as it appeared that investors 
were becoming increasingly concerned about the economic outlook and the downside 
risks to activity. Participants discussed the possibility that these 
developments could lead to an excessive pull-back in credit availability and in 
investment. Although inflation was expected to moderate from recent elevated 
levels, participants stressed that this outlook relied upon inflation 
expectations remaining well anchored and that the inflation situation should 
continue to be monitored carefully.

All members judged that a substantial easing in policy in the near term was 
appropriate to foster moderate economic growth and reduce the downside risks to 
economic activity. Most members judged that an immediate reduction in the 
federal funds rate was called for to begin aligning the real policy rate with a 
weakening economic situation. Such an action, by demonstrating the Committee's 
commitment to act decisively to support economic activity, might reduce concerns 
about economic prospects that seemed to be contributing to the deteriorating 
conditions in financial markets, which could feed back on the economy. However, 
some concern was expressed that an immediate policy action could be 
misinterpreted as directed at recent declines in stock prices, rather than the 
broader economic outlook, and one member believed it preferable to delay policy 
action until the scheduled FOMC meeting on January 29-30. Some members also 
noted that were policy to become very stimulative it would be important for the 
Committee to be decisive in reversing the course of interest rates once the 
economy had strengthened and downside risks had abated.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 
domestic policy directive:

"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 
will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further 
its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average 
of around 3-1/2 percent."

The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement 
to be released at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, January 22:

“The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the 
federal funds rate 75 basis points to 3-1/2 percent.

The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook 
and increasing downside risks to growth. While strains in short-term funding 
markets have eased somewhat, broader financial market conditions have continued 
to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and 
households. Moreover, incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing 
contraction as well as some softening in labor markets.

The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be 
necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.

Appreciable downside risks to growth remain. The Committee will continue to 
assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and 
will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks.”

Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke, Geithner, Evans, Hoenig, Kohn, 
Kroszner, Rosengren, and Warsh.

Votes against this action: Mr. Poole

Absent and not voting: Mr. Mishkin

Mr. Poole dissented because he did not believe that current conditions justified 
policy action before the regularly scheduled meeting the following week.
