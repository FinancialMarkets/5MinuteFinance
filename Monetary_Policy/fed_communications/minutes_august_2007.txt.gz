In the agenda for this meeting, it was reported that advices of the election of 
Eric S. Rosengren as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee had been 
received and that he had executed his oath of office.

By unanimous vote, the Federal Open Market Committee selected Brian F. Madigan 
to serve as Secretary and Economist until the selection of a successor at the 
first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in 2008.

The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in 
foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign 
currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting. 
The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on 
System open market operations in government securities and federal agency 
obligations during the period since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the 
Committee ratified these transactions.

The information reviewed at the August meeting suggested that economic activity 
picked up in the second quarter from the slow pace in the first quarter. On 
average, the economy expanded at a moderate pace during the first half of the 
year despite the ongoing drag from the housing sector. While the growth of 
consumer spending slowed in the second quarter from its rapid pace in prior 
quarters, wages and salaries increased solidly and household sentiment appeared 
supportive of further gains in spending. Business fixed investment picked up in 
the second quarter after little net change in the preceding two quarters. 
Inventories generally appeared to be well aligned with sales at midyear. Overall 
inflation receded in June because of a decline in energy prices, while the core 
personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index rose a bit less than its 
average pace over the past year.

Private nonfarm payroll employment continued to increase at a healthy pace; the 
rise in July was about equal to the average increase over the first half of the 
year. Solid hiring in the service sector was partly offset by declines in 
construction and manufacturing employment. Most of the drop in construction 
employment occurred in jobs typically associated with nonresidential 
construction. Both the average workweek and aggregate hours ticked down in July. 
The unemployment rate edged up to 4.6 percent; it had remained between 4.4 
percent and 4.6 percent since September 2006.

Industrial production picked up in the second quarter after little net change 
over the preceding two quarters. The increase was largely attributable to a 
smaller drag from inventory liquidation and a modest improvement in net exports. 
Manufacturing production rose solidly in the second quarter because of 
substantial increases in the output of light motor vehicles, other durable 
consumer goods, business equipment, construction supplies, and materials. 
Production in high-tech industries rose relatively modestly in comparison to its 
longer-run growth.

The growth of real consumer spending slowed considerably in the second quarter 
after substantial increases earlier in the year. The deceleration primarily 
reflected sharply slower growth in outlays for goods as purchases of motor 
vehicles decreased noticeably. Although a spike in energy prices eroded real 
income growth in the second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and 
salaries. Despite continued softness in house prices, household wealth moved 
markedly higher in the second quarter, mostly reflecting rising equity prices.

Demand for housing in the second quarter was restrained by higher interest rates 
and by tightening credit conditions in the subprime mortgage market. Sales of 
new and existing homes in the second quarter were down substantially from their 
average levels in the second half of 2006. In June, single-family housing starts 
held steady at their May rate, although adjusted permit issuance slipped 
further. The combination of decreased sales and unchanged production left 
inventories of new homes for sale still elevated. House-price appreciation 
continued to slow, with some measures again showing declines in home values.

Outlays for nonresidential construction rose rapidly in the second quarter. 
Business spending on equipment and software, other than transportation 
equipment, posted a solid increase after being flat, on net, in the preceding 
two quarters. The rise was led by a rebound in purchases of industrial 
machinery. Expenditures for computers, software, and communications equipment 
grew moderately in the second quarter after a brisk first-quarter increase. 
Spending on transportation equipment again declined sharply. The drop was 
largely a continuation of the payback from exceptionally strong purchases of 
heavy trucks in 2005 and 2006 in anticipation of tighter emissions standards on 
diesel engines. New orders for medium and heavy trucks edged up in the second 
quarter, though they remained at low levels, suggesting that the downturn in 
business spending on motor vehicles may be ending.

Real nonfarm inventory investment was a roughly neutral influence on real GDP 
growth in the second quarter after having held down the growth rate by an 
average of 1 percentage point in the previous two quarters. Businesses made 
considerable progress in reducing the apparent inventory overhangs that had 
emerged at the end of 2006. In the motor vehicle sector, low rates of assemblies 
in the first half of this year left inventories of domestic light vehicles at 
the end of the second quarter fairly well aligned with sales; however, 
inventories rose again in July as production accelerated and sales remained 
weak. More broadly, the number of purchasing managers who viewed their 
customers' inventory levels as too high in July only slightly exceeded the 
number who saw them as too low.

The U.S. international trade deficit widened in May, as a rise in imports more 
than offset an increase in exports. Within imports, most categories of goods 
recorded an increase, as did services. The value of oil imports rose sharply, 
boosted by a jump in the price of imported oil. The increase in exports was 
largely attributable to capital goods, including aircraft, computers and 
semiconductors, and industrial supplies.

Economic activity in advanced foreign economies expanded somewhat less rapidly 
in the second quarter than in the prior quarter, but nonetheless appeared to 
have grown faster than trend, reflecting upbeat business and consumer confidence 
as well as favorable labor market conditions. Although many of those economies 
recently experienced sharp declines in equity prices and widening credit spreads 
amid deepening concerns about credit quality, these developments occurred too 
late in the intermeeting period to have any apparent effect on incoming data. In 
Japan, survey evidence suggested that its economy expanded moderately. Survey 
evidence indicated high levels of economic sentiment and strong capital spending 
plans among large manufacturers. In the euro area, survey measures of business 
and consumer confidence remained near record highs in July, and labor market 
conditions generally continued to improve in May and June. In the United 
Kingdom, real GDP growth rose in the second quarter, an increase driven mainly 
by robust expansion in the service sector. Canada's growth seemed to continue to 
pick up from its disappointing rate posted in much of last year.

Recent data indicated that economic activity in emerging-market economies 
remained generally strong. The Chinese economy continued to expand at a rapid 
pace, and activity elsewhere in emerging Asia appeared to have accelerated. In 
Latin America, Mexican indicators pointed to a weaker-than-expected rebound in 
the second quarter, whereas Brazil and Argentina appeared to have experienced 
solid growth. While equity prices fell and bond spreads widened in several 
emerging-market economies, particularly in Latin America, there was no evidence 
that this increased volatility had yet weighed on economic activity.

U.S. headline consumer price inflation slowed in June as energy prices flattened 
out after a rapid increase over the preceding three months. Core PCE prices rose 
0.1 percent in June, as a decline in the price index for core goods nearly 
offset a rise in the index for core services. The readings on core PCE price 
inflation in recent months had been held down, in part, by declines in prices of 
some categories of goods, such as apparel, that tend to be volatile on a monthly 
basis. Household surveys conducted in early July indicated that the median 
expectation for inflation over the next year remained unchanged from June's 
elevated level despite declines in gasoline prices in both months. Median 
expectations of longer-term inflation ticked up and were near the top of the 
narrow range that had prevailed over the past few years. The employment cost 
index rose somewhat faster in the second quarter than over the preceding three 
months, and the twelve-month change was slightly higher than that of a year ago.

At its June meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) maintained its 
target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. The statement announcing the 
policy decision noted that economic growth appeared to have been moderate during 
the first half of the year, despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing 
sector. The economy seemed likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over 
coming quarters. Readings on core inflation had improved modestly in recent 
months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be 
convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization had 
the potential to sustain those pressures. The Committee's predominant policy 
concern remained the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected. 
Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.

Market participants had largely anticipated the FOMC's decision at its June 
meeting to leave the target for the federal funds rate unchanged, although the 
accompanying statement expressed greater concern about inflation than investors 
reportedly had foreseen and caused the expected path for the federal funds rate 
to edge higher. Expectations for a policy easing diminished somewhat more in the 
wake of favorable economic news early in the period. Subsequently, the 
semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress and the accompanying 
testimony, which reported lower projections for real GDP growth than investors 
apparently expected, appeared to prompt a downward shift in investors' expected 
path for the federal funds rate. Later in the intermeeting period, growing 
apprehension that turmoil in markets for subprime mortgages and some low-rated 
corporate debt might have adverse effects on economic growth led investors to 
mark down their expectations for the future path of policy considerably further. 
At the same time, measures of long-horizon inflation compensation based on 
inflation-indexed Treasury securities edged down.

Financial market conditions were volatile during the intermeeting period, 
particularly over the last few weeks of the interval. Yields on nominal Treasury 
securities fell on balance, possibly reflecting an increased preference by 
investors for safe assets as well as revisions in policy expectations. 
Conditions in markets for subprime mortgages and related instruments, including 
segments of the asset-backed commercial paper market, deteriorated sharply 
toward the end of the period. Credit conditions for speculative-grade corporate 
borrowers tightened substantially, as investors pulled back from higher-risk 
assets. Spreads on speculative-grade bonds increased to near their highest 
levels in the past four years. A number of high-yield bond and leveraged loan 
deals intended to finance leveraged buyouts were delayed or restructured, though 
other high-yield bonds were issued. In contrast, credit conditions for 
investment-grade businesses and prime households were relatively little affected 
by the market turbulence. Issuance of investment-grade bonds continued. Yields 
on investment-grade corporate issues rose relative to yields on Treasury 
securities, but because yields on Treasuries declined, yields on 
investment-grade bonds were about unchanged on net. Nonfinancial commercial 
paper outstanding posted a modest gain in July, while the pace of bank lending 
to businesses picked up from an already solid clip. Mortgage loans and consumer 
credit appeared to remain readily available to households with strong balance 
sheets, although late in the period some evidence pointed to diminishing 
availability of jumbo mortgages.

Broad stock price indexes declined substantially, on net, over the intermeeting 
period despite generally solid second-quarter earnings reports. Share prices of 
financial firms fell especially sharply, reportedly a reflection, in part, of 
concerns about exposures to subprime mortgages and about the effect of a 
potential slowdown in merger activity on operating profits. The foreign exchange 
value of the dollar against other major currencies fell, on balance.

Growth of home mortgage debt likely slowed again in the second quarter, mainly 
reflecting the decline in home-price appreciation over the past year and the 
drop in home sales. Overall consumer credit expanded moderately through the year 
ending in May. The debt of nonfinancial businesses expanded at a robust pace in 
the second quarter but slowed in July. After rising at a rapid pace in the first 
half of the year, M2 grew at a more moderate rate in July.

In preparation for this meeting, the staff lowered somewhat its forecast of real 
GDP growth in the second half of 2007 and in 2008. The reduction was in part due 
to the annual revision of national income and product accounts (NIPA), which 
revealed somewhat less rapid growth in output and productivity during the past 
three years than previously reported and led the staff to trim its estimates of 
the growth rates of structural productivity and potential GDP; the reduction 
also reflected less accommodative financial conditions and the softer tone of 
some near-term indicators. The near-parallel revisions to the forecasts for 
potential and actual GDP left the staff's projections for resource utilization 
about unchanged. Although part of the recent favorable monthly readings on core 
PCE price changes was expected to be transitory, the staff revised down slightly 
its forecast for core PCE price inflation in the second half of 2007; however, 
in light of slower growth in structural productivity and prospects of somewhat 
greater pressure from import prices, the staff left its projection for core PCE 
inflation unchanged for 2008. Overall PCE inflation was expected to slow in the 
second half of 2007 from the elevated pace of the first half, as the effects of 
the sizable increases in food and energy prices earlier this year abated, and 
then to move down a bit further in 2008.

In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants 
indicated that they still saw moderate economic expansion in coming quarters as 
the most likely outcome but that the downside risks to growth had increased. 
Participants reported that economic expansion had continued at a moderate pace 
in many regions of the country despite further weakness in the housing sector. 
Going forward, most participants anticipated that growth in aggregate demand 
would be supported by rising employment, incomes, and exports, with the result 
that growth in actual output probably would remain close to growth of potential 
GDP despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector. Several mentioned that 
the revisions to the NIPA pointed to a modest downward adjustment in projected 
growth of actual and potential GDP, but thought that potential output growth was 
likely to be a bit higher than forecast by the staff. However, recent spending 
indicators had been mixed, and credit conditions had become tighter, suggesting 
greater downside risks to growth. Participants generally expected that core 
inflation would edge lower over the next two years, reflecting a slight easing 
of pressures on resources, well-anchored inflation expectations, and the waning 
of temporary factors that had boosted prices last year and early this year. 
Participants anticipated that total inflation would slow as well, particularly 
if market expectations of a modest decline in energy prices in coming quarters 
were to prove correct. But they were concerned that the high level of resource 
utilization and slower productivity growth could augment inflation pressures. 
Against this backdrop, the Committee agreed that the risk that inflation would 
fail to moderate as expected remained its predominant policy concern.

Participants agreed that the housing sector was apt to remain a drag on growth 
for some time and represented a significant downside risk to the economic 
outlook. Indeed, developments in mortgage markets during the intermeeting period 
suggested that the adjustment in the housing sector could well prove to be both 
deeper and more prolonged than had seemed likely earlier this year. Participants 
noted that investors had become much more uncertain about the likely future cash 
flows from subprime and certain other nontraditional mortgages, and thus about 
the valuation of securities backed by such mortgages. Consequently, the markets 
for securities backed by subprime and other non-traditional mortgages had become 
illiquid, and originations of new subprime mortgages had dropped sharply. While 
these markets were expected to recover over time, it was anticipated that credit 
standards for these types of mortgages would be tighter, and interest rates 
higher relative to rates on conforming mortgages, in the future than in recent 
years. However, participants also observed that mortgage loans remained readily 
available to most potential borrowers, and that interest rates on conforming, 
conventional mortgage loans had declined in recent weeks, providing some support 
to the housing sector.

Participants thought that consumer expenditures likely would expand at a 
moderate pace in coming quarters, supported by solid gains in employment and 
real income. Though growth in consumer spending had slowed in the second 
quarter, the slowing likely reflected temporary factors in part, including some 
payback from unusually strong growth in prior quarters and the surge in gasoline 
prices. Several participants noted the risks that house prices could decline 
significantly and that credit standards for home equity loans could be tightened 
substantially as factors that could weigh on consumer spending. However, the 
sizable upward revision--from negative to positive--in estimates of the personal 
saving rate during the past three years suggested somewhat less need for 
households to rebuild their savings.

Participants expected that business investment would be supported by solid 
fundamentals, including high profits, strong business balance sheets, and 
moderate growth in output. Recent financial market developments were thought 
unlikely to have an appreciable adverse effect on capital spending. Although 
lenders recently appeared to be less willing to extend credit for financial 
restructuring, the supply of credit to finance real investment did not appear 
significantly diminished. Funding had become more costly and difficult to obtain 
for riskier corporate borrowers, but there had been little net change in the 
cost of credit for investment-grade businesses. Also, businesses in the 
aggregate continued to have sufficient internally generated funds to finance the 
expected level of real investment. Nonetheless, participants recognized that 
conditions in corporate credit markets could change rapidly, and that adverse 
effects on business spending were possible. Moreover, heightened asset market 
volatility and the associated increase in uncertainty, if they were to persist 
for long, could lead businesses to pare capital spending plans. Still, 
participants judged that continued growth of investment outlays going forward 
was the most likely outcome.

Rapid economic growth abroad and the decline in the foreign exchange value of 
the dollar in recent quarters were seen as likely to boost U.S. exports and thus 
support the economic expansion. Some participants also anticipated that growth 
in government purchases of goods and services would support continued growth in 
output.

The data on core inflation received during the intermeeting period were 
favorable, but meeting participants believed that the readings for the past few 
months likely had been damped by transitory factors and did not provide reliable 
evidence that the recent level would be sustained. Still, participants thought 
that a slight decrease in pressures on resources and the stability of inflation 
expectations likely would foster over time a gradual moderation in core 
inflation. Participants anticipated that total inflation would slow as well, 
particularly if market expectations for a modest decline in energy prices in 
coming quarters were to prove correct. Participants remained concerned about 
factors that could augment inflation pressures, including the continuing high 
level of resource utilization and slower trend growth in productivity. Some also 
pointed to the strength of aggregate demand worldwide and the depreciation of 
the dollar, and their potential effects on the prices of imports and globally 
traded commodities, as contributing to upside risks to U.S. inflation. Several 
participants noted significant increases in wages in their Districts, 
particularly in the service sector, but it was also observed that that overall 
gains in labor compensation had remained moderate, suggesting that sustainable 
rates of resource utilization could be slightly higher than typically estimated. 
On balance, participants continued to agree that risks to the outlook for 
sustained moderation in inflation pressures remained tilted to the upside.

In their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee 
members again agreed that maintaining the existing stance of policy at this 
meeting was likely to be consistent with the overall economy expanding at a 
moderate pace over coming quarters and inflation pressures moderating over time. 
The expansion would be supported by solid job gains and rising real incomes that 
would bolster consumption, and by increasing foreign demand for goods and 
services produced in the United States. The ongoing adjustment in housing 
markets likely would exert a restraining influence on overall growth for several 
more quarters and remained a key source of uncertainty about the outlook. The 
recent strains in financial markets posed additional downside risks to economic 
growth. Members expected a return to more normal market conditions, but 
recognized that the process likely would take some time, particularly in markets 
related to subprime mortgages. However, a further deterioration in financial 
conditions could not be ruled out and, to the extent such a development could 
have an adverse effect on growth prospects, might require a policy response. 
Policymakers would need to watch the situation carefully. For the present, 
however, given expectations that the most likely outcome for the economy was 
continued moderate growth, the upside risks to inflation remained the most 
significant policy concern. In these circumstances, members agreed that 
maintaining the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting was 
appropriate.

In light of the recent economic data, anecdotal information, and financial 
market developments, the Committee agreed that the statement to be released 
after the meeting should indicate that economic growth was moderate during the 
first half of the year and that the economy seemed likely to continue to expand 
moderately in coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and 
incomes and by robust economic growth abroad. Members also agreed that the 
statement should incorporate their view that downside risks to growth had 
increased somewhat, and should mention volatile financial markets, tighter 
credit conditions for some households and businesses, and the ongoing correction 
in the housing market. In addition, the Committee agreed that the statement 
should again note that readings on core inflation had improved modestly in 
recent months but did not yet convincingly demonstrate a sustained moderation of 
inflation pressures, and that the high level of resource utilization had the 
potential to sustain inflation pressures. Against this backdrop, members judged 
that the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected continued to 
outweigh other policy concerns.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 
domestic policy directive:

"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 
will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further 
its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an 
average of around 5-1/4 percent."

The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement 
to be released at 2:15 p.m.:

"Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee's 
predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate 
as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both 
inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information."

Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke, Geithner, Hoenig, Kohn, Kroszner, 
Mishkin, Moskow, Poole, Rosengren, and Warsh.

Votes against this action: None.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday, 
September 18, 2007.

The meeting adjourned at 1:25 p.m.
