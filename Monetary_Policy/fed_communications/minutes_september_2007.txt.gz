1.  Attended portion of the meeting relating to the discussion of approaches to 
stabilizing money markets. Return to text

In the agenda for this meeting, it was reported that advices of the election of 
Charles L. Evans as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee had been 
received and that he had executed his oath of office.

By unanimous vote, the Federal Open Market Committee selected James A. Clouse 
and Daniel G. Sullivan to serve as Associate Economists until the selection of 
their successors at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee in 
2008.

The Manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reported on recent 
developments in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations 
in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous 
meeting. The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets 
and on System open market operations in government securities and federal agency 
obligations during the period since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the 
Committee ratified these transactions.

The information reviewed at the September meeting suggested that economic 
activity advanced at a moderate rate early in the third quarter. After expanding 
at a robust pace in July, retail sales rose at a somewhat slower rate in August. 
Orders and shipments of capital goods posted solid gains in July. However, 
residential investment weakened further, even before the recent disruptions in 
mortgage markets. In addition, private payrolls posted only a small gain in 
August, and manufacturing production decreased after gains in the previous two 
months. Meanwhile, core inflation rose a bit from the low rates observed in the 
spring but remained moderate through July.

Private nonfarm payroll employment rose only modestly in August, and the levels 
of employment in June and July were revised down. The weakness in employment was 
spread fairly widely across industries. Residential construction and 
manufacturing posted noticeable declines in jobs, employment in wholesale trade 
and transportation was little changed, and hiring at business services was well 
below recent trends. Both the average workweek and aggregate hours were 
unchanged in August. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.6 percent, 0.1 
percentage point above its second-quarter level and equal to its 2006 average.

After posting solid gains in June and July, total industrial production edged up 
only a bit in August. This increase was attributable to a surge in electricity 
generation, as temperatures swung from mild in July to very warm in August. 
After large gains in the preceding two months, manufacturing output declined in 
August, held down by a decrease in the production of motor vehicles and parts. 
High-tech output rose only modestly in August, but production gains in June and 
July were revised up considerably.

Consumer spending appeared to have strengthened early in the summer from its 
subdued second-quarter pace. Although auto sales were weak in July, real outlays 
for other goods rose briskly. At the same time, spending on services was up 
moderately despite a drop in outlays for energy associated with relatively cool 
weather in the eastern part of the United States. In August, consumption 
appeared to have posted another solid gain. Although nominal retail sales 
outside the motor vehicle sector were about flat (abstracting from a drop in 
nominal sales at gasoline stations associated with falling gas prices), vehicle 
sales stepped up and warmer weather likely caused an increase in energy usage. 
Real disposable income rose further in July, as wages and salaries posted a 
strong gain and energy prices came down. However, household wealth likely was 
providing a diminishing impetus to the pace of spending, reflecting recent 
declines in stock market wealth and an apparent further deceleration in house 
prices. Readings on consumer sentiment turned down in August after having risen 
in July, and the Reuters/Michigan index remained near its relatively low August 
level in early September.

The housing sector remained exceptionally weak. Home sales had dropped 
considerably this year: Sales of new and existing single-family homes in July 
were down substantially from their averages over the second half of last year. 
Demand was restrained by deteriorating conditions in the subprime mortgage 
market and by an increase in rates for thirty-year fixed-rate conforming 
mortgages. In the nonconforming mortgage market, the availability of financing 
to borrowers recently appeared to have been crimped even further. Most 
forward-looking indicators of housing demand, including an index of pending home 
sales, pointed to a further deterioration in sales in the near term. 
Single-family starts slid in July to their lowest reading since 1996, and 
adjusted permit issuance continued on a downward trajectory. Although 
single-family housing starts had come down substantially from their peak, the 
drop had lagged the decline in demand, and as a result, inventories of new homes 
had risen considerably. In the multifamily sector, starts in July were in line 
with readings thus far this year and at the low end of the fairly narrow range 
seen since 1997. Meanwhile, house prices generally continued to decelerate.

Orders and shipments of capital goods posted a strong gain early in the third 
quarter. In particular, orders and shipments of equipment outside the high-tech 
and transportation sector registered a robust increase in July, and data on 
computer production and shipments of high-tech goods pointed to solid increases 
in business demand for high-tech. In contrast, indicators of spending for 
transportation equipment were mixed. Aircraft shipments in July and public 
information on Boeing's deliveries suggested that domestic spending on aircraft 
was retreating somewhat in the current quarter. While fleet sales of light 
vehicles appeared to have moved up in July and August, sales of medium and heavy 
trucks remained below the second-quarter average. More generally, surveys of 
business conditions suggested that increases in business activity were somewhat 
slower in August than in the second quarter.

Book-value data for the manufacturing and trade sectors excluding motor vehicles 
and parts suggested that inventory accumulation stepped down noticeably in July 
from the second-quarter pace. Inventories of light motor vehicles rose again in 
July and August. The number of manufacturing purchasing managers who viewed 
their customers' inventory levels as too low in August slightly exceeded the 
number who saw them as too high.

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in July, as exports 
increased more than imports. Sharp increases in exports of both aircraft and 
automobiles contributed importantly to the overall gain. Exports of agricultural 
products and consumer goods were also strong. In contrast, exports of industrial 
supplies and semiconductors exhibited declines. The value of imported goods and 
services was boosted by a large increase in imports of automotive products. 
Higher imports of capital goods excluding aircraft, computers, and 
semiconductors and of oil also contributed to the overall gain in imports.

Economic growth slowed in the second quarter in most advanced foreign economies, 
except the United Kingdom. The step-down was most pronounced in Japan, where GDP 
contracted, but was also substantial in the euro area, where total domestic 
demand rose only slightly. Although growth remained robust in Canada, data late 
in the quarter, including retail sales, indicated a more significant weakening 
in activity. This softness appeared to have continued into the third quarter in 
some economies. In July, indicators for Europe generally moderated, on balance, 
from their second-quarter levels; those for Canada and Japan, however, slowed 
more notably. Most of the readings available on economic developments after 
August 9, when financial turmoil intensified, were measures of confidence. They 
dropped, on average, but otherwise were consistent with the indicators reported 
for July.

Data through July suggested that economic activity in emerging-market countries 
remained robust. Output in the Asian economies soared in the second quarter, and 
several countries posted growth at or near double-digit rates. In Latin America, 
output in Mexico and Venezuela rebounded sharply from earlier weakness. 
Indicators for China in July pointed to only a modest slowing of output growth 
from its torrid pace in the first half of the year. The scant data for August 
received thus far provided little indication that the turmoil in financial 
markets had a significant negative impact on real economic activity in 
emerging-market economies.

After rapid price increases earlier this year, U.S. headline consumer price 
inflation was moderate in both June and July. Although food prices continued 
their string of sizable increases, energy prices fell in June and July and 
gasoline prices appear to have dropped further in August. Core PCE prices rose 
0.2 percent in June and 0.1 percent in July. On a twelve-month-change basis, 
core PCE inflation in July was below the comparable rate twelve months earlier. 
Step-downs in price inflation for prescription drugs, motor vehicles, and 
nonmarket services accounted for nearly all of the deceleration in core PCE 
prices. Although owners' equivalent rent decelerated over the past year, this 
change was largely offset by an acceleration in tenants' rent and lodging away 
from home. Household surveys indicated that the median expectation for 
year-ahead inflation declined in August and edged down further in early 
September to a level only slightly above the reading at the turn of the year; 
the median expectation of longer-term inflation in early September remained in 
the range seen over the past couple of years. The producer price index for core 
intermediate materials rose only modestly in July. Compensation per hour 
decelerated in the second quarter. Nonetheless, the increase over the four 
quarters ending in the second quarter was noticeably above the increase in the 
preceding four quarters and well above the rise in the employment cost index 
over the same period.

At its August meeting, the FOMC decided to maintain its target for the federal 
funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. In the statement, the Committee acknowledged that 
financial markets had been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions had 
become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction 
was ongoing. The Committee reiterated its view that the economy seemed likely to 
continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid 
growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy. Readings on core 
inflation had improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained 
moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be convincingly demonstrated. 
Moreover, the high level of resource utilization had the potential to sustain 
these pressures. Although the downside risks to growth had increased somewhat, 
the Committee repeated that its predominant policy concern remained the risk 
that inflation would fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments 
would depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied 
by incoming information. The FOMC's policy decision and the accompanying 
statement were about in line with market expectations, and reactions in 
financial markets were muted.

In the days after the August FOMC meeting, financial market participants 
appeared to become more concerned about liquidity and counterparty credit risk. 
Unsecured bank funding markets showed signs of stress, including volatility in 
overnight lending rates, elevated term rates, and illiquidity in term funding 
markets. On August 10, the Federal Reserve issued a statement announcing that it 
was providing liquidity to facilitate the orderly functioning of financial 
markets. The Federal Reserve indicated that it would provide reserves as 
necessary through open market operations to promote trading in the federal funds 
market at rates close to the target rate of 5-1/4 percent. The Federal Reserve 
also noted that the discount window was available as a source of funding.

On August 17, the FOMC issued a statement noting that financial market 
conditions had deteriorated and that tighter credit conditions and increased 
uncertainty had the potential to restrain economic growth going forward. The 
FOMC judged that the downside risks to growth had increased appreciably, 
indicated that it was monitoring the situation, and stated that it was prepared 
to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the 
disruptions in financial markets. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve Board 
announced that, to promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial 
markets, it had approved a 50 basis point reduction in the primary credit rate 
to 5-3/4 percent. The Board also announced a change to the Reserve Banks' usual 
practices to allow the provision of term financing for as long as thirty days, 
renewable by the borrower. In addition, the Board noted that the Federal Reserve 
would continue to accept a broad range of collateral for discount window loans, 
including home mortgages and related assets, while maintaining existing 
collateral margins. On August 21, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced 
some temporary changes to the terms and conditions of the SOMA securities 
lending program, including a reduction in the minimum fee. The effective federal 
funds rate was somewhat below the target rate for a time over the intermeeting 
period, as efforts to keep the funds rate near the target were hampered by 
technical factors and financial market volatility. In the days leading up to the 
FOMC meeting, however, the funds rate traded closer to the target.

Short-term financial markets came under pressure over the intermeeting period 
amid heightened investor unease about exposures to subprime mortgages and to 
structured credit products more generally. Rates on asset-backed commercial 
paper and on low-rated unsecured commercial paper soared, and some issuers, 
particularly asset-backed commercial paper programs with investments in subprime 
mortgages, found it difficult to roll over maturing paper. These developments 
led several programs to draw on backup lines, exercise options to extend the 
maturity of outstanding paper, or even default. As a result, asset-backed 
commercial paper outstanding contracted substantially. Investors sought the 
safety and liquidity of Treasury securities, and yields on Treasury bills 
dropped sharply for a period; trading conditions in the bill market were 
impaired at times. Meanwhile, banks took measures to conserve their liquidity 
and were cautious about counterparties' exposures to asset-backed commercial 
paper. Term interbank funding markets were significantly impaired, with rates 
rising well above expected future overnight rates and traders reporting a 
substantial drop in the availability of term funding. Pressures eased a bit in 
mid-September, but short-term financial markets remained strained.

Conditions in corporate credit markets were mixed. Investment- and 
speculative-grade corporate bond spreads edged up; they were near their highest 
levels in four years, although they remained far below the peaks seen in 
mid-2002. Investment-grade bond issuance was strong in August as yields 
declined, but issuance of speculative-grade bonds was scant. Speculative-grade 
bond deals and leveraged loans slated to finance leveraged buyouts continued to 
be delayed or restructured. Bank lending to businesses surged in August, 
apparently because some banks funded leveraged loans that they had intended to 
syndicate to institutional investors and perhaps because some firms substituted 
bank credit for commercial paper. Although markets for nonconforming mortgages 
were impaired over the intermeeting period, the supply of conforming mortgages 
seemed to have been largely unaffected by recent developments. Broad stock price 
indexes were volatile but about unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period. 
The foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies fell, on 
balance.

Investors appeared to mark down significantly their expected path for the 
federal funds rate during the intermeeting period, evidently in response to the 
strains in money and credit markets and a few key data releases, including 
weaker-than-expected reports on housing activity and employment. Yields on 
nominal Treasury securities fell appreciably across the term structure. 
TIPS-based inflation compensation at the five-year horizon was about unchanged, 
while inflation compensation at longer horizons crept higher.

Growth of nonfinancial domestic debt was estimated to have slowed a little in 
the third quarter from the average pace in the first half of the year. The 
deceleration in total nonfinancial debt reflected a projected slowdown in 
borrowing across all major sectors of the economy excluding the federal 
government. Although it decelerated in the third quarter, business-sector debt 
continued to advance at a solid pace, boosted by a surge in business loans. In 
the household sector, mortgage borrowing was estimated to have slowed notably, 
as mortgage interest rates moved up, nonconforming mortgages became harder to 
obtain, and as home sales slowed and house prices decelerated. M2 increased at a 
brisk pace in August. The rise was led by a surge in liquid deposits and in 
retail money funds as investors adjusted their portfolios in response to the 
turmoil in financial markets.

In preparation for this meeting, the staff continued to estimate that real GDP 
increased at a moderate rate in the third quarter. However, the staff marked 
down the fourth-quarter forecast, reflecting a judgment that the recent 
financial turbulence would impose restraint on economic activity in coming 
months, particularly in the housing sector. The staff also trimmed its forecast 
of real GDP growth in 2008 and anticipated a modest increase in unemployment. 
Softer demand for homes amid a reduction in the availability of mortgage credit 
would likely curtail construction activity through the middle of next year. 
Moreover, lower housing wealth, slower gains in employment and income, and 
reduced confidence seemed likely to restrain consumer spending in 2008. Despite 
the recent difficulties in some corporate credit markets, financial conditions 
confronting most nonfinancial businesses did not appear to have tightened 
appreciably to date. But going forward, the staff anticipated that businesses 
would scale back their capital spending a touch in response to financing 
conditions that were likely to become a little less accommodative and to more 
modest gains in sales. With credit markets expected to largely recover over 
coming quarters, growth of real GDP was projected to firm in 2009 to a pace a 
bit above the rate of growth of its potential. Incoming data on consumer price 
inflation that were slightly to the low side of the previous forecast, in 
combination with the easing of pressures on resource utilization in the current 
forecast, led the staff to trim slightly its forecast for core PCE inflation. 
Headline PCE inflation, which was boosted by sizable increases in energy and 
food prices earlier in the year, was expected to slow in 2008 and 2009.

In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants 
focused on the potential for recent credit market developments to restrain 
aggregate demand in coming quarters. The disruptions to the market for 
nonconforming mortgages were likely to reduce further the demand for housing, 
and recent financial developments could well lead to a more general tightening 
of credit availability. Moreover, some recent data and anecdotal information 
pointed to a possible nascent slowdown in the pace of expansion. Given the 
unusual nature of the current financial shock, participants regarded the outlook 
for economic activity as characterized by particularly high uncertainty, with 
the risks to growth skewed to the downside. Some participants cited concerns 
that a weaker economy could lead to a further tightening of financial 
conditions, which in turn could reinforce the economic slowdown. But 
participants also noted that the resilience of the economy in the face of a 
number of previous periods of financial market disruptions left open the 
possibility that the macroeconomic effects of the financial market turbulence 
would prove limited.

Although financial markets were expected to stabilize over time, participants 
judged that credit markets were likely to restrain economic growth in the period 
ahead. Given existing commitments to customers and the increased resistance of 
investors to purchasing some securitized products, banks might need to take a 
large volume of assets onto their balance sheets over coming weeks, including 
leveraged loans, asset-backed commercial paper, and some types of mortgages. 
Banks' concerns about the implications of rapid growth in their balance sheets 
for their capital ratios and for their liquidity, as well as the recent 
deterioration in various term funding markets, might well lead banks to tighten 
the availability of credit to households and firms. Tighter credit conditions 
were likely to weigh particularly on residential investment and to a lesser 
extent on other components of aggregate demand in coming quarters. Meeting 
participants also noted that financial market conditions, while seeming to have 
improved somewhat in the most recent days, were still fragile and that further 
adverse credit market developments could well increase the downside risks to the 
economy. Even after market volatility subsided and the recent strains eased, 
risk spreads probably would be wider and credit terms tighter than they had been 
a few months ago. Although these developments would likely be consistent with 
longer-term financial stability, they were likely to exert some restraint on 
aggregate demand.

In their discussion of individual sectors of the economy, participants noted 
that recent data suggested greater weakness in the housing market than had 
previously been expected. Furthermore, recent financial developments had the 
potential to deepen further and prolong the downturn in the housing market, as 
subprime mortgages remained essentially unavailable, little activity was evident 
in the markets for other nonprime mortgages, and prime jumbo mortgage borrowers 
faced higher rates and tighter lending standards. The faster pace of 
foreclosures as subprime mortgage rates reset was also seen as posing a downside 
risk to the housing market. Nonetheless, participants observed that conforming 
mortgages remained readily available to creditworthy borrowers and that rates on 
these mortgages had declined in recent weeks. Moreover, conditions in the jumbo 
mortgage market were expected to improve gradually over time.

Although employment probably was not as weak as the most recent monthly data had 
suggested, trend growth in jobs had fallen off even prior to the recent 
financial market strains, and participants judged that some further slowing of 
employment growth was likely. Indeed, financial services firms had already 
announced layoffs, largely reflecting mortgage market developments, the demand 
for temporary workers appeared to have softened, and the most recent weakening 
in construction employment was likely to continue for a while. Moreover, if 
declines in house prices were to damp consumption, that could feed back on 
employment and income, exerting additional restraint on the demand for housing. 
Nonetheless, to date, initial claims for unemployment insurance did not indicate 
a substantial and widespread weakening in labor demand, and labor markets across 
the country generally remained fairly tight, with several participants citing 
continued reports of shortages of labor from their contacts in some sectors.

Participants thought that the most likely prospect was for consumer expenditures 
to continue to expand at a moderate pace on average over coming quarters, 
supported by growth in employment and income. However, some participants saw 
indications of a possible weakening of consumer spending. Sales of automobiles 
and building materials had flagged of late, and survey measures suggested that 
consumer confidence had been adversely affected by the recent financial market 
developments. Also, a further tightening of terms for home equity lines of 
credit and second mortgages seemed possible, which could weigh on consumer 
spending, especially for consumer durables.

Participants reported that recent financial market developments generally 
appeared to have had limited effects to date on business capital spending plans 
and expected that business investment was likely to remain healthy in coming 
quarters. The access of investment-grade corporate borrowers to credit so far 
remained unimpeded, and rates on investment-grade bonds had declined in recent 
weeks. Moreover, participants noted that many capital expenditures were 
internally financed, making them less sensitive to credit market conditions. 
Nonetheless, the pace of financing for lower-rated firms--including issuance of 
both speculative-grade bonds and leveraged loans--had slowed sharply over the 
summer. Participants also noted that standards and terms for commercial real 
estate credit reportedly had tightened, and that credit availability for 
homebuilders could be trimmed going forward. In addition, contacts indicated 
that business executives in parts of the country had apparently become somewhat 
more cautious and that some were delaying investment outlays in view of 
heightened economic and financial uncertainty.

Some participants noted that foreign demand remained robust and net exports 
appeared strong. Port utilization rates reportedly remained high. Participants 
discussed the turbulence in foreign financial markets and noted that unusually 
high precautionary demand for dollar-denominated term funding in Europe had 
added to strains in U.S. interbank markets and contributed to a wide spread 
between libor and federal funds rates.

Participants made only modest revisions to their outlook for inflation in the 
period since the Committee's last regular meeting. Still, they recognized that 
incoming data on core inflation continued to be favorable, and they generally 
were a little more confident that the decline in inflation earlier this year 
would be sustained. Inflation expectations seemed to be contained, and the less 
robust economic outlook implied somewhat less pressure on resources going 
forward. Participants nonetheless remained concerned about possible upside risks 
to inflation. Higher benefit costs, rising unit labor costs more generally, 
reduced markups, and levels of resource utilization both in the United States 
and abroad that remained relatively high were all cited as factors that could 
contribute to inflationary pressures. Inflation risks could be heightened if the 
dollar were to continue to depreciate significantly.

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period, all members 
favored an easing of the stance of monetary policy. Members emphasized that 
because of the recent sharp change in credit market conditions, the incoming 
data in many cases were of limited value in assessing the likely evolution of 
economic activity and prices, on which the Committee's policy decision must be 
based. Members judged that a lowering of the target funds rate was appropriate 
to help offset the effects of tighter financial conditions on the economic 
outlook. Without such policy action, members saw a risk that tightening credit 
conditions and an intensifying housing correction would lead to significant 
broader weakness in output and employment. Similarly, the impaired functioning 
of financial markets might persist for some time or possibly worsen, with 
negative implications for economic activity. In order to help forestall some of 
the adverse effects on the economy that might otherwise arise, all members 
agreed that a rate cut of 50 basis points at this meeting was the most prudent 
course of action. Such a measure should not interfere with an adjustment to more 
realistic pricing of risk or with the gains and losses that implied for 
participants in financial markets. With economic growth likely to run below its 
potential for a while and with incoming inflation data to the favorable side, 
the easing of policy seemed unlikely to affect adversely the outlook for 
inflation.

The Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should 
indicate that the outlook for economic growth had shifted appreciably since the 
Committee's last regular meeting but that the 50 basis point easing in policy 
should help to promote moderate growth over time. They also agreed that the 
inflation situation seemed to have improved slightly and judged that it was no 
longer appropriate to indicate that a sustained moderation in inflation 
pressures had yet to be shown. Nonetheless, all agreed that some inflation risks 
remained and that the statement should indicate that the Committee would 
continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Given the heightened 
uncertainty about the economic outlook, the Committee decided to refrain from 
providing an explicit assessment of the balance of risks, as such a 
characterization could give the mistaken impression that the Committee was more 
certain about the economic outlook than was in fact the case. Future actions 
would depend on how economic prospects were affected by evolving market 
developments and by other factors.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 
domestic policy directive:

"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 
will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further 
its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average 
of around 4-3/4 percent."

The vote encompassed approval of the text below for inclusion in the statement 
to be released at 2:15 p.m.:

"Developments in financial markets since the Committee's last regular meeting 
have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. The Committee 
will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic 
prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable 
economic growth."

Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke, Geithner, Evans, Hoenig, Kohn, 
Kroszner, Mishkin, Poole, Rosengren, and Warsh.

Votes against this action: None.

The Committee then resumed its discussion of monetary policy communication 
issues. Subsequently, in a joint session of the Federal Open Market Committee 
and the Board of Governors, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents discussed 
additional policy options to address strains in money markets. No decisions were 
made in this session, but it was agreed that policymakers should continue to 
consider such options carefully.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on 
Tuesday-Wednesday, October 30-31, 2007.

The meeting adjourned at 3:55 p.m.

Notation Vote

By notation vote completed on August 27, 2007, the Committee unanimously 
approved the minutes of the FOMC meeting held on August 7, 2007.

Conference Calls
On August 10, 2007, the Committee reviewed developments in money and credit 
markets, where strains had worsened in the days since its last meeting. 
Participants discussed the condition of domestic and foreign financial markets, 
the Open Market Desk's approach to open market operations, possible adjustments 
to the discount rate, and the statement to be issued immediately after the 
conference call.

On August 16, 2007, the Committee again met by conference call. With financial 
market conditions having deteriorated further, meeting participants discussed 
the potential usefulness of various policy responses. The discussion focused 
primarily on changes associated with the discount window that would be directed 
at improving the functioning of the money markets. Most participants expressed 
strong support for taking such steps, although some concern was noted about the 
likely effectiveness of these measures and one participant also questioned their 
appropriateness. In light of the risks posed to the economic outlook by the 
tighter credit conditions and the increased uncertainty in financial markets, 
the Committee felt that the downside risks to growth had increased appreciably, 
but that a change in the federal funds rate target was not yet warranted. 
However, the situation bore close watching.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to approve the text 
below to be released the following morning:

"Financial market conditions have deteriorated, and tighter credit conditions 
and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going 
forward. In these circumstances, although recent data suggest that the economy 
has continued to expand at a moderate pace, the Federal Open Market Committee 
judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably. The 
Committee is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to 
mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in 
financial markets."

Votes for: Messrs. Bernanke, Geithner, Fisher, Hoenig, Kohn, Kroszner, Mishkin, 
Moskow, Rosengren, and Warsh.

Votes against: None.

Mr. Fisher voted as alternate member.
