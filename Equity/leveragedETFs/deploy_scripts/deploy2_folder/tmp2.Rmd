## Leveraged ETFs

Leveraged ETFs seek to return some multiple of an index.  For example, ticker SSO targets a return which is 2 times (2X) the return on the S&P 500.

-  So the leveraged ETF is similar to buying an index on margin.

-  There are also inverse leveraged ETFs.  These seek to return some negative multiple of an index.


## Leveraged ETF Quotes

On the next slide you can see a quote for an ETF, and a leveraged ETF, on the same index.

-  The quote shows the daily percent return.  Note the leverage ETF does a fairly good job of returning a multiple of the index over a single day.

-  The ETF is the top quote, and the 2X leveraged ETF is below.

## When Do Leveraged ETFs Not Work?

Leveraged ETFs do a good job of returning a multiple of an index's return over a single day.

-  However, over any time period longer than a day, the Leveraged ETF return will depart from being a simple multiple of the index.

-  Also, the longer you hold the Leveraged ETF, the more its return will diverge from being a multiple of the underlying index.


## Why is the Leveraged ETF Error Greater Over Longer Holding Periods?

Say both an ETF on an index and a leveraged ETF are trading for $100.  The index declines by 2% today, so the ETF declines to $98 and the leveraged ETF declines to $96.  Now say tomorrow the index increases by 3%, so the ETF increases to $100.94 and the leveraged ETF increases to $99.64.

-  The ETF has a two-day return of 0.94%, and the leveraged ETF returned -0.36%.

-  This is caused by the nature of returns, and is not a fault in the way leveraged ETFs are managed. 


## Interactive App

You can use the app on the following slide to see the divergence in the return of an ETF and leveraged ETF on an index.

-  The ETF returns are multiplied by 2, because each leveraged ETF is a 2X.

-  Change the length of time, and see how this affects the divergence.
