## Introduction to Stock Markets

The goal of stock markets is to facilitate the exchange of ownership of corporations (common stock).  There are *primary* and *secondary* markets.

-  Primary: an exchange of stock in which the company is a buyer or seller.
-  Secondary:  an exchange of stock in which the company is not involved.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

##  Secondary Market

This is the market you see every day in the news, and the one we'll cover in this presentation.

-  We care how well the secondary market functions (because we are participants), but do companies care?

>-  Yes! A well-functioning secondary market will mean the company gets higher prices for the stock it sells in the primary market.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Secondary Markets and Economic Growth

-  The more money a company can raise in the primary market, the more the company can invest in real assets, research and development, and other uses.

-  So well-functioning secondary stock markets lead to higher levels of investment and employment, and faster economic growth.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## The Market Participants

The market is comprised of the market makers, and those wishing to exchange stock.

-  A market maker, at all times, posts prices at which they are willing to buy (the bid) or sell (the offer or ask).

-  Those wishing to trade stock could be trading for themselves, or on behalf of another (in which case they are acting as a broker).

-  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulates stock markets.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## A Physical Location

Until recently, the market was a physical place.  It was the place that the market maker stood.  

-  Brokers and traders who wanted to trade, say GE, would congregate around GE's market maker.

-  The New York Stock Exchange famously started under a buttonwood tree outside 68 Wall Street.  

[graphic:  traders congregating around a central market maker -- under a tree] 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Where were the Markets?

A stock often traded on many exchanges around the US.

-  For example, historically IBM traded on the NYSE, and also on minor regional exchanges.
-  Central reporting of quotes and trades on each exchange was done through the [consolidated tape system](http://www.sec.gov/answers/consolt.htm) implemented in 1976.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Are You Getting the Best Price?

With the same stock trading on many exchanges across the country, how do you ensure you are getting the best price? The SEC gave this a great deal of thought.

## Regulation National Market System (Reg NMS)

Starting in 1975, the SEC began to work on a national market system.   In 2005 much of this work was consolidated into [Reg NMS](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-51808.pdf), which among other things sought to:

-   ensure investors were getting the best price across all exchanges for their purchase or sale of stock (known as the "Order Protection Rule").
-  provide all investors fair access to price quotations, and to also set a limit on access fees ("Access Rule").
-  restrict sub-penny quotations.

## What is an Exchange Today?

An exchange is a data center which houses computer servers which runs an order matching engine. A good description of an order matching system is provided by the [Chicago Stock Exchange](http://www.chx.com/trading-information/matching-system/).

- The order matching engine is an algorithm which handles orders according to a set of rules.  Some rules are exchange specific, and some rules are the same across all exchanges. 

- In essence the matching engine receives orders, maintains a ranking of orders according to a set of rules, and looks at whether it can fill the order within the NBBO.  If it cannot it doesn't execute the order.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Present Exchange Participants

There are still market makers, brokers, and investors in today's markets.

-  What has changed is where they communicate, and many of the rules by which they trade (such as order type and who gets to trade first).

-  Moving to purely electronic communication has also greatly increased the speed with which market participants can trade.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Where are the Markets Today

There are presently [18 national securities exchanges](http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrexchanges.shtml) registered with the SEC.

-  They are primarily located in New Jersey and Chicago.

-  In the past there were main and regional markets.  However the 18 present exchanges are much more equal when it comes to trading volume.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Market Location Interactive Map

-  The following map shows locations of the exchanges -- note this is the location of the servers, and not the corporate headquarters.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Information Flow

Because it takes time for information to travel from one exchange to another, orders at one exchange are not instantaneously reflected at another exchange.  

- Exchanges which are closer to each other will tend to have more similar quotes (at the millisecond and microsecond level).

-  This means we can see exchanges as a set of linked groups, where each group has a similar information content. 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Exchange Network

- In the next app, you can see the exchanges grouped by how similar their quotes will be to other exchanges (based on distance to the other exchange).  
  
- The two exchange groups are light blue for the New Jersey area, and dark blue for the CME (where S&P 500 futures are traded) and Chicago Stock Exchange.

-  The lines linking the exchanges represent paths of information flow. The longer the line between two exchanges, the longer it takes for information to be exchanged.

-  Each exchange is identified by its [Market Identifier Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Identifier_Code).  The listing of codes and exchanges is on slides 25 and 26.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Information Generation
  
- The orange nodes represent where a great deal of information, which affects stock prices, is generated.  These are Manhattan (NYC) and Washington D.C. (where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) releases its statements on monetary policy).

-  The closer an exchange is to where the information is generated, the faster it will incorporate that information into prices.

-  Feel free to move the nodes around to get a better look.

-  Placing the cursor over a node will show its name.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Dark Pools

In addition to national and regional stock exchanges, some organizations have set up *Dark Pools*.

-  If you send an order to an exchange, the order can be seen by the public.  Also trades on a public exchange generate information which is then reflected on other public exchanges.  

-  In a dark pool you can send an indication of interest to buy or sell a stock, and this indication is only available to those with access to the dark pool. Also trades in the dark pool are not quickly made known to public exchanges.

[graphic: dark water] 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Why Trade in Dark Pools?

The benefit of sending an order to a dark pool is that you may be able to hide large orders. 

-  Say you send a large buy order to an exchange.  When your intentions become public, the price will tend to increase causing you to have to pay more for the shares. 

Despite trading in a dark pool, you should still receive no worse than the best bids and offers among public exchanges.  

-  However, dark pools may not presently report trades within the pool with the accuracy required to enforce deviations from the best bids and offers.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Who Operates Dark Pools?

Dark pools are run by (1) independent organizations, (2) broker-dealers such as JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, and Fidelity, and (3) public exchanges.  

-  There are about 40 dark pools today.  

[graphic: lots of little dark pools]

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Information Transfer with Public Exchanges 

Dark pools might show up in our network as independent nodes. 

-  This is because trade and quote information is hidden from public exchanges.  So trades in the dark pool will not generate information flow to other exchanges. 

-  Dark pools show up in light orange in the following network graphic.

## Stock Quotes

Stocks are often identified by a specific ticker symbol, such as 'CL' for the Colgate-Palmolive Company.  This ticker is unique to Colgate-Palmolive across all US stock exchanges.

-  However 'CL' means the light sweet crude oil contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  So 'CL' can have different meanings on other types of exchanges.

When you see a stock ticker with something like: 'CL 67.04 +0.04' it means Colgate-Palmolive last traded for \$67.04 per share, which is 4 cents higher than the last trade in Colgate-Palmolive yesterday.  The last trade in Colgate-Palmolive yesterday is known as yesterday's 'closing price'.
