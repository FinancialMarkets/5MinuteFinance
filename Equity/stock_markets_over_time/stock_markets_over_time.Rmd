## Stock Markets

The goal of stock markets is to facilitate the exchange of ownership of corporations (common stock).  There are *primary* and *secondary* markets.

-  Primary: an exchange of stock in which the company is a buyer or seller.
-  Secondary:  an exchange of stock in which the company is not involved.

##  Secondary Market

This is the market you see every day in the news, and the one we'll cover in this presentation.

-  We care how well the secondary market functions (because we are participants), but do companies care?

>-  Yes! A well-functioning secondary market will mean the company gets higher prices for the stock it sells in the primary market.

## Secondary Markets and Economic Growth

-  The more money a company can raise in the primary market, the more the company can invest in real assets, research and development, and other uses.

-  So well-functioning secondary stock markets lead to higher levels of investment and employment, and faster economic growth.  

## The Market Participants

The market is comprised of the market makers, and those wishing to exchange stock.

-  A market maker, at all times, posts prices at which they are willing to buy (the bid) or sell (the offer or ask).

-  Those wishing to trade stock could be trading for themselves, or on behalf of another (in which case they are acting as a broker).

-  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulates stock markets.  

## A Physical Location

Until recently, the market was a physical place.  It was the place that the market maker stood.  

-  Brokers and traders who wanted to trade, say GE, would congregate around GE's market maker.

-  The New York Stock Exchange famously started under a buttonwood tree outside 68 Wall Street.

## Where were the Markets?

A stock often traded on many exchanges around the US.

-  For example, historically IBM traded on the NYSE, and also on minor regional exchanges.
-  Central reporting of quotes and trades on each exchange was done through the [consolidated tape system](http://www.sec.gov/answers/consolt.htm) implemented in 1976.

## What is an Exchange Today?

An exchange is a data center which houses computer servers which runs an order matching engine. A good description of an order matching system is provided by the [Chicago Stock Exchange](http://www.chx.com/trading-information/matching-system/).

- The order matching engine is an algorithm which handles orders according to a set of rules.  Some rules are exchange specific, and some rules are the same across all exchanges. 

- In essence the matching engine receives orders, maintains a ranking of orders according to a set of rules, and looks at whether it can fill the order within the NBBO.  If it cannot it doesn't execute the order.

## Present Exchange Participants

There are still market makers, brokers, and investors in today's markets.

-  What has changed is where they communicate, and many of the rules by which they trade (such as order type and who gets to trade first).

-  Moving to purely electronic communication has also greatly increased the speed with which market participants can trade.

## Where are the Markets Today

There are presently [18 national securities exchanges](http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrexchanges.shtml) registered with the SEC.

-  They are primarily located in New Jersey and Chicago.

-  In the past there were main and regional markets.  However the 18 present exchanges are much more equal when it comes to trading volume.

## Market Location Interactive Map

-  The following map shows locations of the exchanges -- note this is the location of the servers, and not the corporate headquarters.   

-  You can zoom in to see more detail.

## Exchange Network

- In the next app, you can see the exchanges grouped by how similar their quotes will be to other exchanges (based on distance to the other exchange).  
  
- The two exchange groups are light blue for the New Jersey area, and dark blue for the CME (where S&P 500 futures are traded) and Chicago Stock Exchange.

-  The lines linking the exchanges represent paths of information flow. The longer the line between two exchanges, the longer it takes for information to be exchanged.

-  Each exchange is identified by its [Market Identifier Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Identifier_Code).  The listing of codes and exchanges is on slides 25 and 26.

## Information Generation
  
- The orange nodes represent where a great deal of information, which affects stock prices, is generated.  These are Manhattan (NYC) and Washington D.C. (where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) releases its statements on monetary policy).

-  The closer an exchange is to where the information is generated, the faster it will incorporate that information into prices.

-  Feel free to move the nodes around to get a better look.

-  Placing the cursor over a node will show its name.
