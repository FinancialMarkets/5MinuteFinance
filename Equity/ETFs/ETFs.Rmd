## Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

ETFs are typically portfolios of stock which track an index and trade throughout the day.

-  They are like open-ended mutual funds, which have replaced active management with a strategy of passively matching an index's returns.

-  For example, the ticker SPY is for an ETF which matches the return (prior to fees) on the S&P 500 index. Because the fund is passively managed, fees are usually very low at around 0.10% of assets per year.

## ETF Popularity and Growth

ETFs have become very popular in the last decade.  Among their advantages over traditional mutual funds are:

-  ETFs can be traded throughout the day, and may be [shorted](http://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/short-selling-stock) and bought on margin.  The cost of buying an ETF is the same as stock.
-  Selling an ETF doesn't cause fund redemptions -- which can have adverse tax consequences.
  + Fund redemption fees are charges made typically by mutual fund companies to discourage investors from making short term trades
-  ETFs have low fees -- many prominent ETFs have annual fees that are less than 0.15% of assets.
-  Actively managed mutual funds have generally been unable to beat stock index returns.

<!---There are many proposed reasons for this, however most agree it is due to low ETF fees, coupled with an inability of active mutual funds to beat index returns. -->

## New ETFs

While the first ETFs were mainly for broad stock indexes (the NASDAQ 100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as a few examples), their rising popularity of has spurred the creation of ETFs for a variety of underlying assets, such as the following:

-  Stock sectors: Financials, Energy, etc. 
-  Commodities: Crude Oil, Gold, Natural Gas, among others
-  Non-Stock Indexes: the VIX volatility index
-  'Actively managed' ETFs
-  [Leveraged ETFs](http://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/leveraged-exchange-traded-funds)

##  How Well Do ETFs Track Their Underlying Index?

The next slide will show you the cumulative returns for the ETF and index you choose.

-  Generally, for the established stock index ETFs, the ETF tracks the index very closely.

-  However, because there are many new and often exotic ETFs introduced each year, one can't make a blanket statement across all ETFs.

## ETF Performance

As you can see, the difference in cumulative returns between the ETF and the actual stock index over 10 years is generally less than a percent.

In summary, these ETFs do a good job of matching index performance.

## ETFs versus ETNs

-  Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) are unsecured debt obligations of financial institutions.
-  ETNs are also traded on securities exchanges and can be bought or sold on the exchanges.
-  ETNs unlike ETFs do not own a portfolio of underlying assets. ETNs calculate the value using a described formula, rather than using net asset value.
