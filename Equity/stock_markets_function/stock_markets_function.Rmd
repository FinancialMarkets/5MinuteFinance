## Stock Markets

The goal of stock markets is to facilitate the exchange of ownership of corporations (common stock).  There are *primary* and *secondary* markets.

-  Primary: an exchange of stock in which the company is a buyer or seller.
-  Secondary:  an exchange of stock in which the company is not involved.

##  Secondary Market

This is the market you see every day in the news, and the one we'll cover in this presentation.

-  We care how well the secondary market functions (because we are participants), but do companies care?

>-  Yes! A well-functioning secondary market will mean the company gets higher prices for the stock it sells in the primary market.

## Secondary Markets and Economic Growth

-  The more money a company can raise in the primary market, the more the company can invest in real assets, research and development, and other uses.

-  So well-functioning secondary stock markets lead to higher levels of investment and employment, and faster economic growth.

## Are You Getting the Best Price?

With the same stock trading on many exchanges across the country, how do you ensure you are getting the best price? The SEC gave this a great deal of thought.

## Regulation National Market System (Reg NMS)

Starting in 1975, the SEC began to work on a national market system.   In 2005 much of this work was consolidated into [Reg NMS](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-51808.pdf), which among other things sought to:

-   ensure investors were getting the best price across all exchanges for their purchase or sale of stock (known as the "Order Protection Rule").
-  provide all investors fair access to price quotations, and to also set a limit on access fees ("Access Rule").
-  restrict sub-penny quotations.

## Information Flow

Because it takes time for information to travel from one exchange to another, orders at one exchange are not instantaneously reflected at another exchange.  

- Exchanges which are closer to each other will tend to have more similar quotes (at the millisecond and microsecond level).

-  This means we can see exchanges as a set of linked groups, where each group has a similar information content. 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Exchange Network

- In the next app, you can see the exchanges grouped by how similar their quotes will be to other exchanges (based on distance to the other exchange).  
  
- The two exchange groups are light blue for the New Jersey area, and dark blue for the CME (where S&P 500 futures are traded) and Chicago Stock Exchange.

-  The lines linking the exchanges represent paths of information flow. The longer the line between two exchanges, the longer it takes for information to be exchanged.

-  Each exchange is identified by its [Market Identifier Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Identifier_Code).  The listing of codes and exchanges is on slides 25 and 26.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Information Generation
  
- The orange nodes represent where a great deal of information, which affects stock prices, is generated.  These are Manhattan (NYC) and Washington D.C. (where the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) releases its statements on monetary policy).

-  The closer an exchange is to where the information is generated, the faster it will incorporate that information into prices.

-  Feel free to move the nodes around to get a better look.

-  Placing the cursor over a node will show its name.
