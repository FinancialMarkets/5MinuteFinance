## Bond Convexity

Bond convexity refers to the actual convex (non-linear) relationship between a bond's price and yield.  This is stated in relation to the linear [duration](http://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/duration) approximation of the bond price and yield relationship.

-  Convexity is often used as a general term for the approximation error that exists when using duration to approximate interest rate risk.

-  The idea is this: duration is a linear (first derivative) approximation.  To make the approximation more accurate, we can include a second-derivative adjustment, which is known as the *convexity adjustment*.  

-  The convexity adjustment is more important as the change in yield increases.

-  This is most easily understood graphically.

## Interactive Duration/Convexity App

The interactive app on the following slide allows you to see, for varying yields, a bond's actual price, the price predicted by duration, and the effect of convexity.  

- Observe that duration always predicts that the bond's price will be lower than it will actually be. Bond owners love convexity!

You can also see the effect of the coupon, [YTM](http://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/for-what-is-the-yield-to-maturity-used), and maturity on the bond's duration and convexity.

- A steeper slope means a higher duration (more interest rate risk).

- When changing the coupon rate and maturity, note the changing values on the vertical axis to see the slope steepening and flattening.

## Calculating Convexity

To approximate the change in the bond's price given a particular change in yield, we add the convexity adjustment to our original duration calculation.  Convexity (C) is defined as:

-  $C = \frac{1}{P}\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial y^2}$

-  where $P$ is the bond's price, and $y$ its yield-to-maturity.

Taking the second derivative of the bond's price with respect to yield affords:

-  $\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial y^2} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} t(t+1)\frac{C_t}{(1+y)^{t+2}}$

-  where $t$ is each period (coupon payment), numbered from $1$ to $T$, and $C_t$ is the payment amount in that period.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Duration with Convexity Adjustment

And so the approximation of the change in the bond's price for a given change in yield ($\Delta y$), including both duration and convexity, is:

- $\Delta P = D^*P\Delta y + \frac{1}{2}CP(\Delta y)^2$

- where $D^*$ is the bond's *Modified Duration*.

On the next slide is an interactive duration and convexity calculator.
