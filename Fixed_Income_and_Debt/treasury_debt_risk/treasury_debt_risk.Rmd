<!--- change presentation to focus on the present state of treasury debt; who owns the debt and what types are outstanding --> 

## This Presentation is a Work-in-Progress

We invite you to contribute by adding code on GitHub. You can do so [here](https://github.com/FinancialMarkets/5MinuteFinance/blob/master/Fixed_Income_and_Debt/treasury_debt_risk/treasury_debt_risk.Rmd). 

## Introduction to Treasury Debt Risk

Our goal is to understand the amount of risk in the U.S.'s outstanding Treasury debt, particularly relative to historical levels.

- The result is useful in understanding the risk in the U.S. banking system.

-  Furthermore, ownership of U.S. Treasury debt has been markedly affected by recent unconconventional modetary policy (Quantitative Easing). In the following slides, we'll also want to take a look at recent trends in U.S. Treasury ownership and issuance.  

-  This is particularly timely given the effect of Quantitative Easing and other unconventional monetary policy on Treasury markets.

-  Unprecedented easing by foreign central banks (particularly the ECB, BOE, and the BOJ) has had a large effect on US Treasury markets.

## Determinants of Bond Risk

A bond is generally more risky...

1. ... the lower the bond's yield.
2. ... the lower the bond's coupon rate.
3. ... the longer the bond's time to maturity.

Let's look at how U.S. Treasury debt in light of these three indicators.

## Coupons on Outstanding Treasuries have Declined

New Treasury bonds are issued at a rate reflecting present market yields.

-  So, as yields have delined, so have coupon rates on newly issued Treasuries.

<!---
Total Debt, quarterly: GFDEBTN
Other stuff here:  https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/search?st=Treasury+Debt

-->

## What Does this Mean?

Note that risk is assuming a parallel shift along the curve.

Rates won't rise at all points of the yield curve, so this will lessen the impact of a FOMC increase.

maybe dont include below 
## Risk Increases in Lower Yields

Consider a 10 year treasury note with a 5\% coupon.

-  If the bond's yield is 8\% and it increases to 8.25\%, then the bond's price will decline by 1.83\%.

-  If the bond's yield is 1\% and it increases to 1.25\%, then the bond's price will decline by 2.05\%.

If the differential seems small, keep in mind it is \$2.2 billion difference on \$1 trillion in debt.

## Risk Increases in Lower Coupons

Consider a 10 year treasury note with an increase in yield from 2\% to 3\%.

-  If the bond's coupon is 10\%, then the bond's price will decline by \%.

-  If the bond's coupon is 1\%, then the bond's price will decline by \%.
