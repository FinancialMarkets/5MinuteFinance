<!--- change presentation to focus on the present state of treasury debt; who owns the debt and what types are outstanding --> 

## Goal of the Presentation

<!--- To understand the amount of risk in the US's outstanding Treasury debt, particularly relative to historical levels.

- The result is useful in understanding the risk in the US banking system.

-  Further, ownership of US Treasury debt has been markedly affected by recent unconconventional modetary policy (Quantitative Easing).  -->

To take a look at recent trends in US Treasury ownership and issuance.  This is particularly timely given the effect of Quantitative Easing and other unconventional monetary policy on Treasury markets.  

- Further, unprecedented easing by foreign central banks (particularly the ECB, BOE, and the BOJ) has had a large effect on US Treasury markets.

## Determinants of Bond Risk

A Bond is generally more risky the:

1. lower the bond's yield.
2. lower the bond's coupon rate.
3. longer the bond's time to maturity.

## Coupons on Outstanding Treasuries have Declined over Time

New Treasury bonds are issued at a rate reflecting present market yields.

-  So, as yields have delined, so have coupon rates on newly issued Treasuries.

## Treasury Bonds Today

[Here are historical average rates back to 2001 from the US Treasury](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/rates/pd/avg/avg.htm)

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Risk in 2015 is Higher than in 198X

<!--- given data above, calculate the effect of a 1\% increase (parallel shift) in yields).
maybe have an app that lets you choose the year and estimates the losses generated by a 1\% increase in yields

## Treasury and Agency Debt held by Commercial Banks as a Proportion of GDP

dygraph(debtOverGDP) %>%

```


<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 
<!---But are commercial banks holding less than before: what does (debt held by banks / total debt) look like? -->

<!---
Total Debt, quarterly: GFDEBTN
Other stuff here:  https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/search?st=Treasury+Debt

-->

## What Does this Mean?  

Note risk is assuming a parallel shift along the curve.

Rates won't rise at all points of the yield curve, so this will lessen the impact of a FOMC increase.


<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 
<!--- maybe dont include below 
## Risk Increases in Lower Yields 

Consider a 10 year treasury note with a 5\% coupon.

-  If the bond's yield is 8\% and it increases to 8.25\%, then the bond's price will decline by 1.83\%. 

-  If the bond's yield is 1\% and it increases to 1.25\%, then the bond's price will decline by 2.05\%. 

If the differential seems small, keep in mind it is \$2.2 billion difference on \$1 trillion in debt. 

## Risk Increases in Lower Coupons

Consider a 10 year treasury note with an increase in yield from 2\% to 3\%.

-  If the bond's coupon is 10\%, then the bond's price will decline by \%. 

-  If the bond's coupon is 1\%, then the bond's price will decline by \%.
