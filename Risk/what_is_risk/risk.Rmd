## Risk

Risk is a statement about the likelihood of adverse events.  There are differing ways to classify 'adverse event' which leads to differing measures and ways of stating risk, such as:

- The average return deviation from the mean (standard deviation)

- The expected loss if the return over a period is less than 10\%.

- The probability you lose over $\$X$ in a given month.

To find these values, we'll need some description of how our security (or portfolio) behaves.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Security Behavior

The behavior is described through a [probability density function (PDF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) which gives the likelihood that returns will be in a given interval.

We'll either have to:

1.  Assume a particular PDF and estimate the parameters which describe the PDF.

2.  Use an empirical PDF---a PDF that fits what has happened over some past period.

Either way we must use historical data, or our judgment, to describe future event probabilities.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## The Normal Distribution

The most often assumed PDF is the normal distribution.

- This is partly for mathematical ease: the sum of normals is normal.

The normal distribution is completely determined by its mean and variance (or standard deviation).

- So once we determine these values, we can state the probability of a return being less than any value.

- Note, the normal distribution is symmetric about its mean value.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Standard Deviation and Symmetry

The standard deviation is the average *squared* deviation from the mean. 

-   Squaring means the standard deviation treats positive and negative deviations from the mean equally: $(-7\%)^2 = 7\%^2$. 

- But we only care about the negative returns when calculating risk.

- Since for a symmetric distribution, the probability of a 5\% or more deviation is equivalent to the probability of -5\% or less deviation, it is fine to square the deviation.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Allowing Asymmetry

What if return distributions are not symmetric?  Say the distribution is left-skewed.

- Then the average negative return is greater than the average positive return.

- In this case using a measure like standard deviation would understate risk.

For non-symmetric distributions, the act of squaring loses important information about risk.

- Specifically, it loses the scale of the average negative return with respect to the average positive return. 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## What about Fat Tails?

Fat tails (excess kurtosis) is also a salient feature of asset returns.

- A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3.  A distribution has fat tails if the kurtosis is greater than 3.

- If the tails are fatter than the normal distribution, then there will be more large positive and negative returns (tail events) than you may expect.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

##  Historical vs (Symmetric) Normal Distribution

In the following app we'll calculate and plot the empirical PDF of the stock's returns.  We'll then use the stock's historical mean return and standard deviation to overlay a normal distribution.

- If the empirical distribution seems to lean (is skewed) relative to the normal, then standard deviation is a poor measure of risk.

- Similarly, pay attention to the difference between the two distributions near the tails.

<!---
On the second tab the results of hypothesis tests for skewness ad kurtosis are returned.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Empirical vs Normal Distribution

- Take a look at Twitter (TWTR) over 2014.  The stock's returns exhibit both negative skewness and kurtosis.  This means the standard deviation would have understated risk. 

- Looking at Apple (AAPL) from 1/2015 through 4/2015 shows a symmetric, fairly normal, distribution -- the standard deviation would have been a good measure of risk.

- GE from 1/2015 to 4/2015 shows positive skewness.  The standard deviation would have overstated risk.

## Value at Risk (VaR)

VaR is a very common way of stating the amount of risk. 

- 5\% VaR is the return for which, in any given period, there is a 5\% chance of experiencing a worse return.  So say the 5\% VaR is -8\%. Then there is a 5\% chance of experiencing a return less than -8\% over the next period.    

- VaR solely focuses on the left tail of the return distribution. 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## VaR Implementation

VaR is widely used and is written into banking regulations.  

VaR still requires an assumption concerning the returns' PDF.

- We can again assume a normal, empirical, or other distribution. 

- If we assume a normal, then VaR is simply a function of the mean and standard deviation.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## VaR App

The following app will calculate the \% VaR for any stock over any tome interval you choose.  

- Click the "Normal" and "Empirical" tabs to see the VaR assuming a normal PDF (using the historical mean and standard deviation), and a PDF fit to historical data. 

- Can you find stocks for which the normal and empirical VaR are different?  Is the difference in VaR greater if you use 1\% VaR versus 5\% VaR?

## Continuing from Here

In the following presentations on risk we'll cover topics such as:

- The extent to which the parameters of the PDF change over time (and particularly during a financial crisis).

- Measures specifically designed for asymmetric distributions, such as *Lower Partial Standard Deviation*.
