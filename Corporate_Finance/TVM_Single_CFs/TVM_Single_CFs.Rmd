## Motivation

What does it mean to say that money has a "time value?". Well, ask yourself the question: Would you rather have a dollar today or a dollar a year from now? You'd rather have the dollar today, so we say that a dollar today has more value than a dollar a year from now.  

Why is that? We point to two reasons:
- Inflation: If the prices of things go up over the course of the year, the dollar you get in a year will buy less goods
- Credit risk: You have to take the risk for a year that you might not actually get that dollar

Now we can ask the following question:  How much money would you need to receive a year from now to be indifferent between a dollar today and money in a year.  $1.05? $1.50? $2.00?  That difference is the time value of money to you.  

In this presentation we'll cover the basic mechanics understanding and calculating the time value of money.

## A General Approach

Say we have \$1 today, and we can invest this dollar *every year* at 7\% per year.  

- Then at the end of 1 year we'll have $\$1(1 + 0.07) = \$1.07$
- At the end of two years we'll have $\$1.07(1 + 0.07) = \$1(1.07)(1.07) = \$1(1.07^2) = \$1.1449$
- At the end of 3 years we'll have $\$1.1449(1.07) = \$1(1.07^3) = \$1.2250$
- ...
- At the end of *n* years ...

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## The General Formula 

Proceeding this way for *n* periods (here a period is a year) we can see the future value (*FV*) of some amount of money today (denote this as *PV*) at time *n* is:

-  $FV = PV(1 + r)^n$

-  Where we assume we can reinvest our money ever year at *r*.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Interactive App

The following app will calculate the future value of \$1 for every year up to the maximum year you select.  You can also select the interest rate per year.  

-  Note the marked exponential increase as you increase the interest rate and number of years.  This shows the exponential effect of compounding.

-  You can also use the app to see the effect of small differences in interest rates on the future value over many years.  For example, the future value of a dollar is worth 33\% more if invested for 30 years at 5\% instead of 4\%.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#{{{
library(metricsgraphics)
inputPanel(
	   sliderInput("rate", label = "Annual Interest Rate", min = -.05, max =0.5, step = .01, value = .05),
	   sliderInput("years", label = "Number of Years", min = 1, max =50, step = 1, value = 10)
	   #            sliderInput("pv", label = "Present Value", min = 1, max =50, step = 1, value = 10),
	   )

renderMetricsgraphics({
  fv <- (1 + input$rate)^{1:input$years}
  fv <- c(1, fv)
  fv <- as.data.frame(cbind(seq(0, input$years, by = 1), fv))
  names(fv) <- c("year", "Future_Value")
  fv %>%
      mjs_plot(x=year, y=Future_Value) %>%
      mjs_line() 
})
#}}}
```

<!-- ## The Effect of Compounding 
add an app which shows the future value broken into simple and compound interest? 


-->


## Rearranging the Formula

So now that we have the general formula which describes how a single cash flow moves through time:

- $FV = PV(1 + r)^n$
 
We can now use this to solve for the *PV*, *r*, and *n*.  Rearranging for the present value gives: 

- $PV = \frac{FV}{(1+r)^n}$

-  This shows that the present value decreases if the interest rate increases.  This relationship is very important in asset pricing.
-  Findng the present value is often termed *discounting*.

library(metricsgraphics)
inputPanel(
	   sliderInput("rate1", label = "Annual Interest Rate", min = -.05, max =0.5, step = .01, value = .05),
	   sliderInput("years1", label = "Years Discounted", min = 1, max =50, step = 1, value = 10)
	   )

renderMetricsgraphics({
    pv <- 1 / ((1 + input$rate1)^{1:input$years1})
    pv <- c(1, pv)
    pv <- as.data.frame(cbind(seq(0, input$years1, by = 1), pv))
    names(pv) <- c("year", "Present_Value")
    pv %>%
        mjs_plot(x=year, y=Present_Value) %>%
        mjs_line() 
})
                                        #}}}
```

## The Interest Rate

Solving our equation for the interest rate we have: 

 $r = \sqrt[n]{\frac{FV}{PV}} - 1$

- Holding other variables constant, the rate per period $r$ is increasing in $FV$, and decreasing in $PV$ and $r$.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## The Number of Periods

Lastly, solving for the number of periods yields: 

$n = \frac{ln\left(\frac{FV}{PV}\right)}{ln\left(1+r\right)}$

- Holding other variables constant, the number of periods $n$ is also increasing in $FV$, and decreasing in $PV$ and $r$.
