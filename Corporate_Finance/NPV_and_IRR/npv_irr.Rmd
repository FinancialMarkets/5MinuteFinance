## Businesses Make Binary Decisions

<center>**Invest or Do Not Invest**</center>
<br>
<center>![](./binary.jpg)</center>
<br>
<center>**So we need binary decision rules.**</center>
<br>
<br>
This presentation will provide an introduction to the two most important, Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Maximize Shareholder Wealth

Early in your study of corporate finance you should have learned the **Goal of Financial Management** above.  Clearly any decision rules we define must be consistent with this goal.

-  NPV will be the change in the value of the firm's equity if the project is accepted.

-  IRR will also generate accept decisions only if doing so increases the firm's equity.

Thus accepting all projects which have NPV > 0 will maximize shareholder wealth.

## Net Present Value (NPV)

*Net Present Value* is the sum of the investment's expected cash inflows and outflows discounted back to their present value at a risk adjusted rate. 

The NPV is defined by: 

$NPV = -C_0 + \frac{C_1}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{C_2}{(1+r)^2} + ... + \frac{C_n}{(1+r)^n}$ 

where: 

- $r$, is the discount rate per period
- $n$, the number of periods in the project's life
- $C$, the expected **incremental** cash flows per period
- $C_0$, the initial investment

## NPV Desicion Rule
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<center>$NPV > \$0 \Rightarrow \text{Accept}$
<br>
<br>
<br>
$NPV < \$0 \Rightarrow \text{Reject}$</center>

## The Discount Rate

The discount rate is the rate required on other projects of similar risk.  You can think of it as an *opportunity cost*, because if the firm didn't use the funds for the project, then it could be paid as a dividend to shareholders.  Shareholders then can invest the money in a financial asset earning that assets required return.

-  Often the project is as risky as a company's existing operations, in which case you use the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

-  It is incorrect to use the firm's cost of borrowing, for a couple reasons.  First the investment decision should be independent of the capital structure decision.  Also, by increasing borrowing, you increase your cost of equity capital [Modigliani and Miller, Proposition II](https://micfm.shinyapps.io/MM_propositions_mobile/). So debt only *appears* cheap.

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

*Internal Rate of Return* is the discount rate ($r_{IRR}$) that makes the Net Present Value equal zero.  That is, we solve the following equation for the $IRR$, using an algorithm such as the [Newton-Raphson method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method).
<br>
<br>
$-C_0 + \frac{C_1}{(1+r_{IRR})^1} + \frac{C_2}{(1+r_{IRR})^2} + ... + \frac{C_n}{(1+r_{IRR})^n} = 0$ 

Note while NPV will have a unique solution, IRR may have multiple solutions depending on the signs of the cash flows.  The interested reader can understand why by consulting the [Fundamental Theorem of Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra), [Descartes' Rule of Signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_rule_of_signs), and [Sturm's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturm%27s_theorem).

## Choosing Between Projects

When the accept/reject decision on one project does not affect another project, these projects are known as **independent**.  If accepting one project means you must reject another, then these projects are **mutually exclusive**. 

If a project has negative cash flows followed by all positive cash flows, then the project's cash flows are known as **conventional**.

-  If two projects are independent and have conventional cash flows, then NPV and IRR will lead to the same accept/reject decision, i.e. $NPV \iff IRR$.  This is shown on the app in the following slide.

-  However, if you must rank projects -- and projects are either mutually exclusive or cash flows are not conventional -- then use NPV.  NPV will generate the correct decision, though IRR may not.
