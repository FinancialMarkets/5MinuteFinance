## The Goal of Financial Management

`The goal of financial management is to maximize shareholder wealth.` For public companies this is the stock price, and for private companies this is the market value of the owners' equity. 

-  We'll discuss the drawbacks of other potential measures.

-  We'll also explain why this measure makes sense, and why it limits excessive risk-taking. 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Alternative Measures

Some might offer goals such as `maximize cash flows` or `maximize profit` for financial management. What problems arise from these goals? 

-  Relatively minor problems relate to how to measure the cash flows---should they be the average cash flow over some period (and what period)?

-  In other words, these measures are *ambiguous*. 

-  `Maximizing shoreholder wealth` is not ambiguous.  There is one unique share price.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## The Larger Problem

The larger problem with measures such as `maximizing profit` or `cash flows` is that the they lack *balance*. In finance and investments, risk is balanced with reward.  You can't have one without the other. And so you can't consider the reward without also considering the risk you *must* take to earn that reward.

- That is the problem with these alternative measures.  They consider reward (profit and cash flows) without considering the risk it takes to maximize them.

- Thus, setting these as goals of management, may lead management to take excessive risks (because risk isn't even considered).

<!--- emphasize the importance of balance in finance, balancing risk and reward.  Maximizing shareholder wealth is a balanced approach, whereas maximizing cash flows or profits is not. -->

## Excessive Risk

As an example, let's say the goal was to maximize cash flow.  Now, assume the following scenario:  

-  Your company has \$100,000 to invest in houses.  There are 100 houses, each house costs \$100,000, and their prices will increase by 1\% over the next year. 

-  You are able to borrow up to a maximum of 100-to-1 leverage.  

-  You will sell all investments at the end of the year.

-  Assume interest rates and taxes are 0\% (this is only saves us from immaterial calculations).

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Expected Cash Flow

Consider the two possible investments:

#. You can invest \$100,000 in one house.  In this case you expect to earn \$1,000 cash flow (or profit) over the year.

#. You can invest \$1,000 each in 100 houses.  Now you expect \$100,000 in cash flow.  

In fact, you can see `maximizing cash flow` or `profit` will simply instruct management to borrow as much as possible and use it all to buy houses---that is, this goal will incentivize management *to take on as much risk as possible* without considering the consequences.

## A Stock's Value

The value of a stock (or any asset) is *the sum of all the stock's discounted expected future cash flows (dividends), where the discount rate reflects the risk taken to earn those cash flows*.  So, for example, say a company expects to pay \$10 in dividends per share every year forever.  Then the value of the firm's stock is:

$Value = \$10 + \frac{\$10}{1+k} + \frac{\$10}{(1+k)^2} + \frac{\$10}{(1+k)^3} + \ldots$

where *k* is the firm's cost of equity capital (which increases with the risk the firm takes).  If we assume $k = 8\%$, then the value of the firm's stock is \$125.

* See this presentation on [stock valuation](http://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/an-introduction-to-stock-valuation) for a more detailed treatment.

## Limiting Risk 

So how does this limit risk? A firm may increase risk to increase the value of the stock.  Say the firm can pay \$12 in dividends annually, but it will increase their cost of equity capital to 9\%.  Then the value of the stock is \$133.33, and management of the firm should take the additional risk.

-  However, what if to increase dividends to \$14, the firm's cost of equity becomes 11\%.  Then the firm's value is \$127.27.  The firm thus should not take on the additional risk. Generally, at a certain point, the increase in the cost of equity will always more than offset the increase in increased dividends. 

-  In this way, the goal of financial management naturally limits risk.

## Interactive App

The following interactive application gives you a general idea of how a stock's price reacts to increasing risk. 

-  As you increase risk, both expected cash flows and the required return on equity increase. As long as the effect of increasing expected cash flows dominates, the stock price also increases.

-  However, as risk rises, at some point the effect of the increased required return begins to dominate outcomes, and increasing risk will decrease the stock price.

-  Below is a general example.  The exact point where the effect on the required return dominates would vary from firm to firm.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
inputPanel(
 sliderInput("risk", "Risk (Leverage)", min = 0, max = 100, step = 1, value = 10)
)

renderPlot({

  ## make rate cubic in risk
  rate <- (input$risk / 100)^3 + .02
  ## casf flows increase linearly
  CFs <- 10 *  (input$risk / 100 + 1) - 10
  Value <- CFs / rate

  plot(0, ylim = c(0, 1), xlim = c(0, 1), type = "n",
       xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", ylab = "", xlab = "")

  text(x = 0.5, y = 0.75,
       labels = paste0("Stock price = ", round( Value, 2)), cex = 3)
  
  text(x = .5, y = .5, paste0("Cash Flows = ",
                       round( CFs, 2 ), ";   Req. Return = ", 100 * round( rate, 2 ), "%"),
       cex = 1)

})
```

## The Goal in Other Countries

This presentation has covered the goal of financial management *for U.S. firms*.  The goal of financial management may differ for firms based in other countries.

-  For example in other countries, such as Germany, it is a common requirement to have labor representatives on the Board of Directors of certain firms to advocate for the well-being of workers.  

-  In this case `maximizing shareholder wealth` is not the sole goal of the financial manager.
