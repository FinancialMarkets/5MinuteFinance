## Growth Rates

This presentation will give you an idea of how the growth rate of the firm relates to financing required.


## External Financing Needed (EFN)

$EFN = \frac{Assets}{Sales}\Delta Sales + \frac{Spon. Debt}{Sales}\Delta Sales - PM(Pro. Sales)(1 - d)$

where *d* is the firm's dividend payout ratio, and *PM* the profit margin.  *Spon. Debt* is the amount of debt which is affected by changes in sales. *Pro. Sales* is projected sales, and $\Delta Sales$ is the projected change in sales.

## Internal Growth Rate (IGR)

$IGR = \frac{ROA(b)}{1 - ROA(b)}$

where *ROA* is the firm's return on assets, and *b* is the firm's plowback ratio.
