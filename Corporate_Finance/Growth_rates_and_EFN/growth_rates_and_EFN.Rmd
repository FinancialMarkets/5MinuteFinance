## Growth Rates

This presentation will give you an idea of how the growth rate of the firm relates to financing required.  Let's say you increase your firm's expected sales.  Then:

-  You will also need more assets to provide for the increased sales.

-  An increase in assets will require an increase in the firm's liabilities and/or equity (remember the balance sheet identity).

The amount of assets required will affect the proportion of debt and equity required.

##  Importance

Understanding the relationship between growth and financing will help the firm set coherent goals. For example, you may hear a firm say they want to both increase sales and lower debt levels.  Are these goals compatible?  The following discussion will answer this question.

## External Financing Needed (EFN)

Say we expect sales to increase by $\$\Delta Sales$, and denote the firm's profit margin and dividend payout ratio by *PM* and *d* respectively. Define *Variable Debt* as the amount of debt that increases and decreases with assets. *Pro. Sales* is projected sales, and $\Delta Sales$ is the projected change in sales.  Lastly assume the amount of assets needed to generate a dollar in sales is constant over the range of sales we are considering (constant assets over sales ratio).  Then for a given change in sales, the amount of external financing needed can be calculated by:

$EFN = \frac{Assets}{Sales}\Delta Sales + \frac{Variable Debt}{Sales}\Delta Sales - PM(Pro. Sales)(1 - d)$

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
inputPanel(
  sliderInput("changeSales", "Change in Sales", min = 0, max = 1000, step = 10),
  sliderInput("projSales", "Projected Sales", min = 20000, max = 30000, step = 1000),
  sliderInput("varDebt", "Variable Debt", min = 20000, max = 30000, step = 1000),
  sliderInput("pm", "Profit Margin", min = 0, max = 100, step = 1),
  sliderInput("div", "Dividend Payout Ratio", min = 0, max = 100, step = 1)
)


```

## Internal Growth Rate (IGR)

$IGR = \frac{ROA(b)}{1 - ROA(b)}$

where *ROA* is the firm's return on assets, and *b* is the firm's plowback ratio.

## Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR)

$SGR = \frac{ROE(b)}{1 - ROE(b)}$
