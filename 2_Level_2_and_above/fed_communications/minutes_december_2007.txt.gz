The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in 
foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign 
currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting. 
The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on 
System open market operations in government securities and federal agency 
obligations during the period since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the 
Committee ratified these transactions.

The Committee approved a foreign currency swap arrangement with the Swiss 
National Bank that paralleled the arrangement with the European Central Bank 
approved during the Committee's conference call on December 6, 2007. With Mr. 
Poole dissenting, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York to establish and maintain a reciprocal currency (swap) arrangement for the 
System Open Market Account with the Swiss National Bank in an amount not to 
exceed $4 billion. The Committee authorized associated draws of up to the full 
amount of $4 billion, and the arrangement itself was authorized for a period of 
up to 180 days unless extended by the FOMC. Mr. Poole dissented because he 
viewed the swap agreement as unnecessary in light of the size of the Swiss 
National Bank's dollar-denominated foreign exchange reserves. 

The information reviewed at the December meeting indicated that, after the 
robust gains of the summer, economic activity decelerated significantly in the 
fourth quarter. Consumption growth slowed, and survey measures of sentiment 
dropped further. Many readings from the business sector were also softer:  
Industrial production fell in October, as did orders and shipments of capital 
goods. Employment gains stepped down during the four months ending in November 
from their pace earlier in the year. Headline consumer price inflation moved 
higher in September and October as energy prices increased significantly; core 
inflation also rose but remained moderate.

The slowing in private employment gains was due in large part to the ongoing 
weakness in the housing market. Employment in residential construction posted 
its fourth month of sizable declines in November, and employment in 
housing-related sectors such as finance, real estate, and building-material and 
garden-supply retailers continued to trend down. Elsewhere, factory jobs 
declined again, while employment in most service-producing industries continued 
to move up. Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers edged up in 
October and November. Some indicators from the household survey also suggested 
softening in the labor market, but the unemployment rate held steady at 4.7 
percent through November.

Industrial production fell in October after small increases in the previous two 
months. The index for motor vehicles and parts fell for the third consecutive 
month, and the index for construction supplies moved down for the fourth 
straight month. Materials output also declined in October, with production 
likely curbed by weak demand from the construction and motor vehicle sectors. 
Production in high-tech industries, however, increased modestly, and commercial 
aircraft production registered another solid gain. In November, output appeared 
to have edged up in manufacturing sectors (with the exception of the motor 
vehicles sector) for which weekly physical product data were available.

After posting notable gains in the summer, real consumer spending was nearly 
flat in September and October. Spending on goods excluding motor vehicles was 
little changed on net over that period. Spending on services edged down, 
reflecting an extraordinarily large drop in securities commissions in September. 
The most recent readings on weekly chain store sales as well as industry reports 
and surveys suggested subdued gains in November and an uneven start to the 
holiday shopping season. Sales of light motor vehicles in November remained 
close to the pace that had prevailed since the second quarter. Real disposable 
income was about unchanged in September and October. The Reuters/University of 
Michigan index of consumer sentiment ticked down further in early December as 
respondents took a more pessimistic view of the outlook for their personal 
finances and for business conditions in the year ahead.

In the housing market, new home sales were below their third-quarter pace, and 
sales of existing homes were flat in October following sharp declines in August 
and September. These declines likely were exacerbated by the deterioration in 
nonprime mortgage markets and by the higher interest rates and tighter lending 
conditions for jumbo loans. Single-family housing starts stepped down again in 
October after substantial declines in the June-September period. Yet, because of 
sagging sales, builders made only limited progress in paring down their 
substantial inventories. Single-family permit issuance continued along the steep 
downward trajectory that had begun two years earlier, which pointed toward 
further slowing in homebuilding over the near term. Multifamily starts rebounded 
in October from an unusually low reading in September, and the level of 
multifamily starts was near the midpoint of the range in which this series had 
fluctuated over the past ten years.

Real spending on equipment and software posted a solid increase in the third 
quarter. In October, however, orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods 
excluding aircraft declined, suggesting that some deceleration in spending was 
under way in the fourth quarter. The October decline in orders and shipments was 
led by weakness in the high-tech sector:  Shipments of computers and peripheral 
equipment declined while the industrial production index for computers was flat; 
orders and shipments for communications equipment plunged. Some of that weakness 
may have been attributable to temporary production disruptions stemming from the 
wildfires in Southern California; cutbacks in demand from large financial 
institutions affected by market turmoil may have contributed as well. In the 
transportation equipment category, purchases of medium and heavy trucks changed 
little, and orders data suggested that sales would remain near their current 
levels in the coming months. Orders for equipment outside high-tech and 
transportation rose in October, but shipments were about flat, pointing to a 
weaker fourth quarter for business spending after two quarters of brisk 
increases. Some prominent surveys of business conditions remained consistent 
with modest gains in spending on equipment and software during the fourth 
quarter, but other surveys were less sanguine. In addition, although the cost of 
capital was little changed for borrowers in the investment-grade corporate bond 
market, costs for borrowers in the high-yield corporate bond market were up 
significantly. In the third quarter, corporate cash flows appeared to have 
dropped off, leaving firms with diminished internally generated funds for 
financing investment. Data available through October suggested that 
nonresidential building activity remained vigorous.

Real nonfarm inventory investment excluding motor vehicles increased slightly 
faster in the third quarter than in the second quarter. Outside of motor 
vehicles, the ratio of book-value inventories to sales had ticked up slightly in 
September but remained near the low end of its range in recent years. Book-value 
estimates of the inventory investment of manufacturers--the only inventory data 
available beyond the third quarter--were up in October at about the 
third-quarter pace.

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed slightly in September as an 
increase in exports more than offset higher imports. The September gain in 
exports primarily reflected higher exports of goods; services exports recorded 
moderate growth. Exports of agricultural products exhibited particularly robust 
growth, with both higher prices and greater volumes. Exports of industrial 
supplies and consumer goods also moved up smartly in September. Automotive 
products exports, in contrast, were flat, and capital goods exports fell, led by 
a decline in aircraft. The increase in imports primarily reflected higher 
imports of capital goods, with imports of computers showing particularly strong 
growth. Imports of automotive products, consumer goods, and services also 
increased. Imports of petroleum, however, were flat, and imports of industrial 
supplies fell.

Output growth in the advanced foreign economies picked up in the third quarter. 
In Japan, real output rebounded, led by exports. In the euro area, GDP growth 
returned to a solid pace in the third quarter on the back of a strong recovery 
in investment. In Canada and the United Kingdom, output growth moderated but 
remained robust, as vigorous domestic demand was partly offset by rapid growth 
of imports. Indicators of fourth-quarter activity in the advanced foreign 
economies were less robust on net. Confidence indicators had deteriorated in 
most major economies in the wake of the financial turmoil and remained 
relatively weak. In November, the euro-area and U.K. purchasing managers indexes 
for services were well below their level over the first half of the year; 
nevertheless they pointed to moderate expansion. Labor market conditions 
generally remained relatively strong in recent months. Incoming data on 
emerging-market economies were positive on balance. Overall, growth in emerging 
Asia moderated somewhat in the third quarter from its double-digit pace in the 
second quarter, but remained strong. Economic growth was also solid in Latin 
America, largely reflecting stronger-than-expected activity in Mexico.

In the United States, headline consumer price inflation increased in September 
and October from its low rates in the summer as the surge in crude oil prices 
began to be reflected in retail energy prices. In addition, though the rise in 
food prices in October was slower than in August and September, it remained 
above that of core consumer prices. Excluding food and energy, inflation was 
moderate, although it was up from its low rates in the spring. The pickup in 
core consumer inflation over this period reflected an acceleration in some 
prices that were unusually soft last spring, such as those for apparel, 
prescription drugs, and medical services, as well as nonmarket prices. On a 
twelve-month-change basis, core consumer price inflation was down noticeably 
from a year earlier. In October, the producer price index for core intermediate 
materials moved up only slightly for a second month, and the twelve-month 
increase in these prices was considerably below that of the year-earlier period. 
This pattern reflected, in part, a deceleration in the prices of a wide variety 
of construction materials, such as cement and gypsum, and in the prices of some 
metal products. In response to rising energy prices, household survey measures 
of expectations for year-ahead inflation picked up in November and then edged 
higher in December. Households' longer-term inflation expectations also edged up 
in both November and December. Average hourly earnings increased faster in 
November than in the previous two months. Over the twelve months that ended in 
November, however, this wage measure rose a bit more slowly than over the 
previous twelve months.

At its October meeting, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate 
25 basis points, to 4-1/2 percent. The Board of Governors also approved a 25 
basis point decrease in the discount rate, to 5 percent, leaving the gap between 
the federal funds rate target and the discount rate at 50 basis points. The 
Committee's statement noted that, while economic growth was solid in the third 
quarter and strains in financial markets had eased somewhat on balance, the pace 
of economic expansion would likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the 
intensification of the housing correction. The Committee indicated that its 
action, combined with the policy action taken in September, should help 
forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might 
otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and should promote 
moderate growth over time. Readings on core inflation had improved modestly 
during the year, but the statement noted that recent increases in energy and 
commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on 
inflation. In this context, the Committee judged that some inflation risks 
remained and indicated that it would continue to monitor inflation developments 
carefully. The Committee also judged that, after this action, the upside risks 
to inflation roughly balanced the downside risks to growth. The Committee said 
that it would continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments 
on economic prospects and would act as needed to foster price stability and 
sustainable economic growth.

The Committee's action at its October meeting was largely expected by market 
participants, although the assessment that the upside risks to inflation 
balanced the downside risks to growth was not fully anticipated and apparently 
led investors to revise up slightly the expected path for policy. During the 
intermeeting period, the release of the FOMC minutes and associated summary of 
economic projections, as well as various data releases, elicited only modest 
market reaction. In contrast, markets were buffeted by concerns about the 
potential adverse effects on credit availability and economic growth of sizable 
losses at large financial institutions and of financial market strains in 
general. Market participants marked down their expected path for policy 
substantially, and by the time of the December meeting, investors were virtually 
certain of a rate cut. Two-year Treasury yields fell on net over the 
intermeeting period by an amount about in line with revisions to policy 
expectations. Ten-year Treasury yields also declined, but less than shorter-term 
yields. The steepening of the yield curve was due mostly to sharply lower short- 
and intermediate-term forward rates, consistent with investors' apparently more 
pessimistic outlook for economic growth. TIPS yields fell less than their 
nominal counterparts, implying modest declines in inflation compensation both at 
the five-year and longer horizons.

After showing some signs of improvement in late September and October, 
conditions in financial markets worsened over the intermeeting period. 
Heightened worries about counterparty credit risk, balance sheet constraints, 
and liquidity pressures affected interbank funding markets and commercial paper 
markets, where spreads over risk-free rates rose to levels that were, in some 
cases, higher than those seen in August. Strains in those markets were 
exacerbated by concerns related to year-end pressures. In longer-term corporate 
markets, both investment- and speculative-grade credit spreads widened 
considerably; issuance slowed but remained strong. In housing finance, subprime 
mortgage markets stayed virtually shut, and spreads on jumbo loans apparently 
widened further. Spreads on conforming mortgage products also widened after 
reports of losses and reduced capital ratios at the housing-related 
government-sponsored enterprises. Broad-based equity indexes were volatile and 
ended the period down noticeably. Financial stocks were especially hard hit, 
dropping substantially more than the broad indexes. Similar stresses were 
evident in the financial markets of major foreign economies. The trade-weighted 
foreign exchange value of the dollar against major currencies moved up, on 
balance, over the intermeeting period. 
Debt in the domestic nonfinancial sector was estimated to be increasing somewhat 
more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Nonfinancial 
business debt continued to expand strongly, supported by solid bond issuance and 
by a small rebound in the issuance of commercial paper. Bank loans outstanding 
also continued to rise rapidly. Household mortgage debt was expected to expand 
at a reduced rate in the fourth quarter, reflecting softer home prices and 
declining home sales, as well as a tightening in credit conditions for some 
borrowers. Nonmortgage consumer credit in the fourth quarter appeared to be 
expanding at a moderate pace. In November, M2 growth picked up slightly from its 
October rate. While liquid deposits continued to grow slowly, heightened demand 
for safety and liquidity appeared to boost holdings of retail money market 
mutual funds. Small time deposits continued to expand, likely in part due to 
high rates offered by some depository institutions to attract retail deposits. 
Currency outstanding was about flat in November.

In the forecast prepared for this meeting, the staff revised down its estimate 
of growth in aggregate economic activity in the fourth quarter. Although 
third-quarter real GDP was revised up sharply, most available indicators of 
activity in the fourth quarter were more downbeat than had previously been 
expected. Faster inventory investment contributed importantly to the upward 
revision to third-quarter real GDP, but part of that upswing was expected to be 
unwound in the fourth quarter. The available data for domestic final sales also 
suggested a weaker fourth quarter than had been anticipated. In particular, real 
personal consumption expenditures had been about unchanged in September and 
October, and the contraction in single-family construction had intensified. 
Providing a bit of an offset to these factors, however, was further improvement 
in the external sector. The staff also marked down its projection for the rise 
in real GDP over the remainder of the forecast period. Real GDP was anticipated 
to increase at a rate noticeably below its potential in 2008. Conditions in 
financial markets had deteriorated over the intermeeting period and were 
expected to impose more restraint on residential construction as well as 
consumer and business spending in 2008 than previously expected. In addition, 
compared with the previous forecast, higher oil prices and lower real income 
were expected to weigh on the pace of real activity throughout 2008 and 2009. By 
2009, however, the staff projected that the drag from those factors would lessen 
and that an improvement in mortgage credit availability would lead to a gradual 
recovery in the housing market. Accordingly, economic activity was expected to 
increase at its potential rate in 2009. The external sector was projected to 
continue to support domestic economic activity throughout the forecast period. 
Reflecting upward revisions to previously published data, the forecast for core 
PCE price inflation for 2007 was a bit higher than in the preceding forecast; 
core inflation was projected to hold steady during 2008 as the indirect effects 
of higher energy prices on prices of core consumer goods and services were 
offset by the slight easing of resource pressures and the expected deceleration 
in the prices of nonfuel imported goods. The forecast for headline PCE inflation 
anticipated that retail energy prices would rise sharply in the first quarter of 
2008 and that food price inflation would outpace core price inflation in the 
beginning of the year. As pressures from these sources lessened over the 
remainder of 2008 and in 2009, both core and headline price inflation were 
projected to edge down, and headline inflation was expected to moderate to a 
pace slightly below core inflation.

In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, participants 
generally noted that incoming information pointed to a somewhat weaker outlook 
for spending than at the time of the October meeting. The decline in housing had 
steepened, and consumer outlays appeared to be softening more than anticipated, 
perhaps indicating some spillover from the housing correction to other 
components of spending. These developments, together with renewed strains in 
financial markets, suggested that growth in late 2007 and during 2008 was likely 
to be somewhat more sluggish than participants had indicated in their October 
projections. Still, looking further ahead, participants continued to expect 
that, aided by an easing in the stance of monetary policy, economic growth would 
gradually recover as weakness in the housing sector abated and financial 
conditions improved, allowing the economy to expand at about its trend rate in 
2009. Participants thought that recent increases in energy prices likely would 
boost headline inflation temporarily, but with futures prices pointing to a 
gradual decline in oil prices and with pressures on resource utilization seen as 
likely to ease a bit, most participants continued to anticipate some moderation 
in core and especially headline inflation over the next few years.

Participants discussed in detail the resurgence of stresses in financial markets 
in November. The renewed stresses reflected evidence that the performance of 
mortgage-related assets was deteriorating further, potentially increasing the 
losses that were being borne in part by a number of major financial firms, 
including money-center banks, housing-related government-sponsored enterprises, 
investment banks, and financial guarantors. Moreover, participants recognized 
that some lenders might be exposed to additional losses:  Delinquency rates on 
credit card loans, auto loans, and other forms of consumer credit, while still 
moderate, had increased somewhat, particularly in areas hard hit by house price 
declines and mortgage defaults. Past and prospective losses appeared to be 
spurring lenders to tighten further the terms on new extensions of credit, not 
just in the troubled markets for nonconforming mortgages but, in some cases, for 
other forms of credit as well. In addition, participants noted that some 
intermediaries were facing balance sheet pressures and could become constrained 
by concerns about rating-agency or regulatory capital requirements. Among other 
factors, banks were experiencing unanticipated growth in loans as a result of 
continuing illiquidity in the market for leveraged loans, persisting problems in 
the commercial paper market that had sparked draws on back-up lines of credit, 
and more recently, consolidation of assets of off-balance-sheet affiliates onto 
banks' balance sheets.

Concerns about credit risk and the pressures on banks' balance sheet capacity 
appeared to be contributing to diminished liquidity in interbank markets and to 
a pronounced widening in term spreads for periods extending through year-end. A 
number of participants noted some potential for the Federal Reserve's new Term 
Auction Facility and accompanying actions by other central banks to ameliorate 
pressures in term funding markets. Participants recognized, however, that 
uncertainties about values of mortgage-related assets and related losses, and 
consequently strains in financial markets, could persist for quite some time.

Some participants cited more-positive aspects of recent financial developments. 
A number of large financial intermediaries had been able to raise substantial 
amounts of new capital. Moreover, credit losses and asset write-downs at 
regional and community banks had generally been modest; these institutions 
typically were not facing balance sheet pressures and reportedly had not 
tightened lending standards appreciably, except for those on real estate loans. 
And, although spreads on corporate bonds had widened over the intermeeting 
period, especially for speculative-grade issues, the cost of credit to most 
nonfinancial firms remained relatively low; nonfinancial firms outside of the 
real estate and construction sectors generally reported that credit conditions, 
while somewhat tighter, were not restricting planned investment spending; and 
consumer credit remained readily available for most households. Nonetheless, 
participants agreed that heightened financial stress posed increased downside 
risks to growth and made the outlook for the economy considerably more 
uncertain.

Participants noted the marked deceleration in consumer spending in the national 
data. Real personal consumption expenditures had shown essentially no growth in 
September and October, suggesting that tighter credit conditions, higher 
gasoline prices, and the continuing housing correction might be restraining 
growth in real consumer spending. Retailers reported weaker results in many 
regions of the country, but in some, retailers saw solid growth. Job growth 
rebounded somewhat in October and November, and participants expected continuing 
gains in employment and income to support rising consumer spending, though they 
anticipated slower growth of jobs, income, and spending than in recent years. 
However, consumer confidence recently had dropped by a sizable amount, leading 
some participants to voice concerns that household spending might increase less 
than currently anticipated.

Recent data and anecdotal information indicated that the housing sector was 
weaker than participants had expected at the time of the Committee's previous 
meeting. In light of elevated inventories of unsold homes and the higher cost 
and reduced availability of nonconforming mortgage loans, participants agreed 
that the housing correction was likely to be both deeper and more prolonged than 
they had anticipated in October. Moreover, rising foreclosures and the resulting 
increase in the supply of homes for sale could put additional downward pressure 
on prices, leading to a greater decline in household wealth and potentially to 
further disruptions in the financial markets.

Indicators of capital investment for the nation as a whole suggested solid but 
appreciably less rapid growth in business fixed investment during the fourth 
quarter than the third. Participants reported that firms in some regions and 
industries had indicated they would scale back capital spending, while contacts 
in other parts of the country or industries reported no such change. Similarly, 
business sentiment had deteriorated in many parts of the country, but in other 
areas firms remained cautiously optimistic. Anecdotal evidence generally 
suggested that inventories were not out of line with desired levels. Even so, 
participants expected that inventory accumulation would slow from its elevated 
third-quarter pace. Several participants remarked that, unlike residential real 
estate, commercial and industrial real estate activity remained solid in their 
Districts. But participants also noted the deterioration in the secondary market 
for commercial real estate loans and the possible effects of that development, 
should it persist, on building activity.

The available data showed strong growth abroad and solid gains in U.S. exports. 
Participants noted that rising foreign demand was benefiting U.S. producers of 
manufactured goods and agricultural products, in particular. Exports were 
unlikely to continue growing at the robust rate reported for the third quarter, 
but participants anticipated that the combination of the weaker dollar and 
still-strong, though perhaps less-rapid, growth abroad would mean continued firm 
growth in U.S. exports. Several participants observed, however, that strong 
growth in foreign economies and U.S. exports might not persist if global 
financial conditions were to deteriorate further.

Recent readings on inflation generally were seen as slightly less favorable than 
in earlier months, partly due to upward revisions to previously published data. 
Moreover, earlier increases in energy and food prices likely would imply higher 
headline inflation in the next few months, and past declines in the dollar would 
put upward pressure on import prices. Some participants said that higher input 
costs and rising prices of imports were leading more firms to seek price 
increases for goods and services. However, few business contacts had reported 
unusually large wage increases. Downward revisions to earlier compensation data, 
along with the latest readings on compensation and productivity, indicated only 
moderate pressure on unit labor costs. With futures prices pointing to a gradual 
decline in oil prices and with an anticipation of some easing of pressures on 
resource utilization, participants generally continued to see core PCE inflation 
as likely to trend down a bit over the next few years, as in their October 
projections, and headline inflation as likely to slow more substantially from 
its currently elevated level. Nonetheless, participants remained concerned about 
upside risks to inflation stemming from elevated prices of energy and non-energy 
commodities; some also cited the weaker dollar. Participants agreed that 
continued stable inflation expectations would be essential to achieving and 
sustaining a downward trend to inflation, that well-anchored expectations 
couldn't be taken for granted, and that policymakers would need to continue to 
watch inflation expectations closely.

In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, 
members judged that the softening in the outlook for economic growth warranted 
an easing of the stance of policy at this meeting. In view of the further 
tightening of credit and deterioration of financial market conditions, the 
stance of monetary policy now appeared to be somewhat restrictive. Moreover, the 
downside risks to the expansion, resulting particularly from the weakening of 
the housing sector and the deterioration in credit market conditions, had risen. 
In these circumstances, policy easing would help foster maximum sustainable 
growth and provide some additional insurance against risks. At the same time, 
members noted that policy had already been eased by 75 basis points and that the 
effects of those actions on the real economy would be evident only with a lag. 
And some data, including readings on the labor market, suggested that the 
economy retained forward momentum. Members generally saw overall inflation as 
likely to be lower next year, and core inflation as likely to be stable, even if 
policy were eased somewhat at this meeting; but they judged that some inflation 
pressures and risks remained, including pressures from elevated commodity and 
energy prices and the possibility of upward drift in the public's expectations 
of inflation. Weighing these considerations, nearly all members judged that a 25 
basis point reduction in the Committee's target for the federal funds rate would 
be appropriate at this meeting. Although members agreed that the stance of 
policy should be eased, they also recognized that the situation was quite fluid 
and the economic outlook unusually uncertain. Financial stresses could increase 
further, intensifying the contraction in housing markets and restraining other 
forms of spending. Some members noted the risk of an unfavorable feedback loop 
in which credit market conditions restrained economic growth further, leading to 
additional tightening of credit; such an adverse development could require a 
substantial further easing of policy. Members also recognized that financial 
market conditions might improve more rapidly than members expected, in which 
case a reversal of some of the rate cuts might become appropriate.

The Committee agreed that the statement to be released after this meeting should 
indicate that economic growth appeared to be slowing, reflecting the 
intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and 
consumer spending, and that strains in financial markets had increased. The 
characterization of the inflation situation could be largely unchanged from that 
of the previous meeting. Members agreed that the resurgence of financial 
stresses in November had increased uncertainty about the outlook. Given the 
heightened uncertainty, the Committee decided to refrain from providing an 
explicit assessment of the balance of risks. The Committee agreed on the need to 
remain exceptionally alert to economic and financial developments and their 
effects on the outlook, and members would be prepared to adjust the stance of 
monetary policy if prospects for economic growth or inflation were to worsen.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to 
execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 
domestic policy directive:

"The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that 
will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further 
its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions 
in reserve markets consistent with reducing the federal funds rate to an average 
of around 4-1/4 percent."

The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:15 
p.m.:

"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the 
federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-1/4 percent.

Incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing, reflecting the 
intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and 
consumer spending. Moreover, strains in financial markets have increased in 
recent weeks. Today's action, combined with the policy actions taken earlier, 
should help promote moderate growth over time.

Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but elevated energy 
and commodity prices, among other factors, may put upward pressure on inflation. 
In this context, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it 
will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.

Recent developments, including the deterioration in financial market conditions, 
have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and 
inflation. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and 
other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price 
stability and sustainable economic growth.

Votes for this action: Messrs. Bernanke, Geithner, Evans, Hoenig, Kohn, 
Kroszner, Mishkin, Poole, and Warsh.

Votes against this action: Mr. Rosengren.

Mr. Rosengren dissented because he regarded the weakness in the incoming 
economic data and in the outlook for the economy as warranting a more aggressive 
policy response. In his view, the combination of a deteriorating housing sector, 
slowing consumer and business spending, high energy prices, and ill-functioning 
financial markets suggested heightened risk of continued economic weakness. In 
light of that possibility, a more decisive policy response was called for to 
minimize that risk. In any case, he felt that well-anchored inflation 
expectations and the Committee's ability to reverse course on policy would limit 
the inflation risks of a larger easing move, should the economy instead prove 
significantly stronger than anticipated.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on 
Tuesday-Wednesday, January 29-30, 2008.

The meeting adjourned at 1:15 p.m.

Conference Call
On December 6, 2007, in a joint session of the Federal Open Market Committee and 
the Board of Governors, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents reviewed 
conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets and discussed two proposals 
aimed at improving market functioning. The first proposal was for the 
establishment of a temporary Term Auction Facility (TAF), which would provide 
term funding to eligible depository institutions through an auction mechanism 
beginning in mid-December. Meeting participants recognized that a TAF would not 
address all of the factors giving rise to stresses in money and credit markets, 
notably the ongoing concerns about credit quality and balance sheet pressures. 
Nonetheless, most participants viewed the TAF, which would provide liquidity to 
more counterparties and against a broader range of collateral than used for open 
market operations, as a potentially useful tool. Some mentioned that a TAF could 
help alleviate year-end pressures in money markets. A few participants, however, 
questioned the need for and the likely efficacy of the proposal, expressed 
concerns about the longer-run incentive effects of a TAF, and felt that the 
possible drawbacks could well outweigh any benefits.* Participants generally 
regarded the second proposal, to set up a foreign exchange swap arrangement with 
the European Central Bank, as a positive step in international cooperation to 
address elevated pressures in short-term dollar funding markets.

At the conclusion of the discussion, with Mr. Poole dissenting, the Committee 
voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to establish and maintain a 
reciprocal currency (swap) arrangement for the System Open Market Account with 
the European Central Bank in an amount not to exceed $20 billion. Within that 
aggregate limit, draws of up to $10 billion were authorized, and the arrangement 
itself was authorized for a period of up to 180 days, unless extended by the 
FOMC. Mr. Poole dissented because he viewed the swap agreement as unnecessary in 
light of the size of the European Central Bank's dollar-denominated foreign 
exchange reserves.
