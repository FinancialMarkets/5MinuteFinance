## Is a Company's Market Risk Constant?

Every undergraduate Finance student learns the CAPM, and at some point ([similar to this presentation](https://micfm.shinyapps.io/The_CAPM/)) estimates a firm's market risk ($\beta$) with the following regression:

$R_{s,t} = \alpha + \beta R_{m,t} + e_t$

where $R_{s,t}$, and $R_{m,t}$, are the return on some stock, and the return on the market, at time $t$.

Often the interested student will ask if market risk is really constant as the above equation assumes.  We could investigate this by breaking up a long time period into smaller subintervals, and estimating the above equation for each subinterval.

##  Interactive App

Input a ticker in the app on the following slide, and it will break the last 5 years into 30 day periods, estimate $\beta$ over each period, and plot the time series of $\beta$s.

-  The default shows Citigroup's (ticker 'C') $\beta$ coefficient over time.  It starts at about 1 in 2010, and increases to about 4 by 2011.  From 2012 onward it ranges from 1 to 2.5.  Clearly there is significant variation in Citigroup's market risk over time.

-  For a formal test of instability in estimated coefficients see [the code for](https://github.com/Matt-Brigida/BDE_75/blob/master/BDE_75_test.R) the [Brown, Durbin, and Evans (1975)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=brown+durbin+evans+1975) test.

    data.mat <- matrix(data, ncol = 2)

    n <- floor(dim(data.mat)[1]/30)
    a <- rep(0, n)
    b <- rep(0, n)
    for (i in 1:n) {
        g <- 30 * (i - 1)
        h <- 30 * i
        reg <- lm(data.mat[g:h, 1] ~ data.mat[g:h, 2])
        a[i] <- reg$coef[1]
        b[i] <- reg$coef[2]
    }

    id <- index(to.monthly(data))
    a.xts <- as.xts(a, order.by = id[(length(id) - length(a) + 1):length(id)])
    b.xts <- as.xts(b, order.by = id[(length(id) - length(a) + 1):length(id)])
    names(b.xts) <- "Beta"
    dygraph(b.xts)

})

## Model Form

In addition to non-constant market risk, the beta coefficient may vary also because of ommitted variables---other factors are known to affect the return on stock.  

-  Below we don't intend to provide a complete model of asset returns (which is an ongoing area of research).

-  That said, whatever factors you use may have a time-varying effect on asset return, and thus they can be modeled using the below approach.

## A More Formal Approach

Instead of running a separate regression over short intervals (assuming the coefficient is constant over each interval), we can formally assume that the coefficient may vary.  We do so by writing the equation in [state space]() form.  We then construct the likelihood function using [prediction error decomposition]().
