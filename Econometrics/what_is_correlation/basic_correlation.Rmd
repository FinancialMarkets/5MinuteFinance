## What is Correlation?

Most have a general idea that correlation is a measure of how closely the behavior of one variable mirrors the behavior of another.  This is true, with some important qualifications we'll discuss below.  

Correlation is measured on a scale ranging from -1 to 1.  

-  -1: perfect negative correlation

-  0: no correlation
  
-  1: perfect positive correlation

## Correlation is Linear!

Most often, correlation is measured with the **Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient**.

- The most important thing to remember about this measure is that is *linear*.  It is a measure of linear dependence.  

- The practical implication:  multiplying either variable by a constant will not change the correlation.  

$Cor(X, Y) = Cor(X, 5Y) = Cor(8X, 2Y) = Cor(7X, Y)$  

- Where $Cor$ denotes correlation and where we can, of course, replace the numbers 5, 8, 2 and 7 with any others.

## Correlation, Beta, and Market Crashes

The above explains why, during a market crash, stock correlations approach 1 while many stocks have high (> 5) [betas](http://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/the-capital-asset-pricing-model).

- Some stock returns effectively become linear multiples of the market return -- they may decrease 6\% for every 1\% decline in the market.

This also helps explain the optimal hedge ratio (see the [Cross Hedging](http://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/cross-hedging) and [First Look at Risk](http://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/intro-risk) presentations). Even if the assets are perfectly correlated, you will likely have a hedge ratio different from 1 given different volatilities.

## Interactive App

In the app on the following slide, change the 'Correlation' slider to generate random numbers with a particular correlation. (Note: it may be a bit off because it is a random sample taken from a distribution with that correlation coefficient.)

-  Changing the 'Multiple' slider will multiply the 'x' variable by that number.  You'll see it doesn't change the correlation coefficient -- only the slope of the graph. Linear transformations do not affect correlation.

-  Then choose the radio button to square 'z'.  You'll see this transformation will change the correlation.  Nonlinear transformations do affect correlation.

##  Stock Return Correlations

In the following app you can input stock tickers and see the correlation matrix of the stocks' returns.  

- Can you find stocks with negative correlations?
